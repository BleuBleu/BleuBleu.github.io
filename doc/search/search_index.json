Please use the User Guide menu above to navigate the the various sections of the documentation or use the Search button to search for a specific topic. Tutorials Here is a short YouTube video tutorial series to get you started. Part 1 - Your First Song The quickest way of getting started with FamiStudio is simply to follow this tutorial video step by step. It will walk you through the creation a simple song, from beginning to end. Part 2 - Advanced Edition This second part will cover some more advanced topics that could not be included in the first tutorial. Part 3 - Advanced Tempo This third part will show you the 2 tempo modes that are supported by FamiStudio. Installation Depending on how you download FamiStudio, you might get scary warnings the first time you try to install or run it. Windows On Windows, if you get an error trying to start the application, but sure to install these 2 requirements: You will need the Visual Studio 2015 runtime (x86 version) You also may need (especially on Windows 7) to install this rather old and cluncky DirectX package It is going to ask you to extra the files to somewhere, extract to a temporary folder Run DXSETUP.exe inside that temporary folder to really install. Delete the temp folder afterwards to cleanup. On Windows, SmartScreen might say \"Windows protected your PC\". To bypass the warning, simply click \"More Info\" and then \"Run Anyway\". MacOS On MacOS, you will need to install Mono . GateKeeper can be quite agressive when first running the application. At first it will look like you simply cannot run it and it will give you the option to throw FamiStudio in the recycling bin. To bypass this warning, open the \"Security and Privacy\" settings and look for the warning saying that FamiStudio was blocked. Click \"Open Anyway\" and then you will have the option to launch it. Linux The Linux version should work on most x64 ditros. But given the very non-stardard nature of the OS, your mileage may vary. Please install the following dependencies before trying ot run the Linux version. Install Mono Install gtk-sharp2, this is usually by typing this, but this might vary depending on your distro : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 Then to run provided amd64 (basically any x64 processor), simply run: mono FamiStudio.exe If you run a very old version of Linux or if you are running an exotic architecture, you may have missing dependencies. If this is the case, you may have to compile some of the libraries. This is a rather manual process. Please follow the build steps on GitHub .","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"Welcome to the FamiStudio documentation.

Patterns contain Notes which are played by an Instrument (DPCM samples do not require an instrument). Instruments may have some of their attributes (pitch, volume, arpeggio) modulated by Envelopes. Most of the operations are performed with the mouse. In general: The left mouse button adds stuff, double-clicking something edits properties (songs, patterns, instruments, DPCM) The right mouse button removes stuff. Right clicking in the header of the Sequencer or Piano Roll selects. The middle mouse button pans when you press it and zooms and you use the mouse wheel. Alternatively, if your mouse does not have a middle mouse button or mouse wheel: All actions requiring pressing the middle mouse buttons can be done with Alt+Left click. All actions requiring the mouse wheel can be performed with Alt+Right click, then dragging up/down. If you are working on a trackpad, please check out how to enable Trackpad controls in the configuration dialog. Main Window The UI was designed to be a simple as possible, there are almost no context menus. The main window has 4 main components: The Toolbar (on top) The Project Explorer (on the right) is where you add/remove/edit songs and instruments. The Sequencer (below the toolbar) is where you schedule your patterns on one of the 5 channels. It gives a high-level view of the song. The Piano Roll (below the sequencer) is where you edit your patterns. At any given moment there is always: A selected channel, in bold in the sequencer A selected song, in bold in the project explorer song list A selected instrument, in bold in the project explorer instrument list. The sequencer and piano roll will display the information for the currently selected song. When pressing the keys on the piano roll, it will play notes for the currently selected instrument, and output it on the currently selected channel. The same applies if you have a MIDI keyboard connected. Toolbar The main toolbar contains your usual stuff: file operation, undo/redo, timecode and play control. Tooltip Keyboard shortcuts or special actions are always displayed as tooltips in the upper-right corner of the toolbar. Please keep an eye on it to learn new functionalities. Playing/pausing the song Besides the toolbar, space bar is used to play/pause the song. Ctrl-space plays in pattern loop mode, Shift-space plays in song loop mode. Changing the looping mode There are 3 looping modes: Song : loops the entire song Pattern : loops at the end of the current pattern None : stops at the end of the song Saving the project Clicking on the icon save the project, right-clicking is a \"save as...\" and will prompt you for a new filename. Exporting to various formats Please see the Import/Export section for details on how to export to various formats. Cleanup dialog Please see the Cleanup section for details on how to cleanup your project. Configuration dialog Please see the Configuration section for details on how to configure FamiStudio. Project Explorer The project explorer displays the list of songs and instruments in the current project. For more details on what you can do with the Project Explorer, please check out these sections: * Editing Songs & Project * Editing Instruments Sequencer The sequencer is where you organize the high-level structure of the song: which patterns play and when they play. The thumbnails of the patterns in the sequencer are by no mean accurate. Please visit the Editing Patterns section for more details. Piano Roll The piano roll is where you editing the actual notes of the song, the instrument envelopes, as well as some special effects. Please check out the Editing Notes section for more details. Keyboard shortcuts Here is a list of useful keyboard shortcuts: Space : Play/stop the stop Ctrl+Space : Plays from beginning of current pattern. Shift+Space : Plays from beginning of the song. Home : Seeks back to beginning of the song. Ctrl+Home : Seeks to beginning of the current pattern. Esc : Stops any stop, clears the selection. Ctrl+Z : Undo Ctrl+Y : Redo Ctrl+N : New project Ctrl+S : Save Ctrl+E : Export Ctrl+O : Open Delete : Delete selected patterns or notes. Escape : Deselects patterns or notes, stops any sound that is stuck playing. 1...5 : Changes the active channel (more than 5 if you have expansion audio enabled). Ctrl+1...5 : Force display a channel. (more than 5 if you have expansion audio enabled). Some keyboard shortcuts specific to the sequencer: L+Click : Sets the loop point at the clicked pattern. Some keyboard shortcuts specific to the piano roll: Ctrl+Click : Adds a stop note. Shift+Click : Adds a release note. S+Click (and drag): Creates or edit a slide note. A+Click : Toggles the attack of a note. ~ (Tilde) : Expand/collapse the effect panel. Shift+S : Toggles snapping.","title":"Basics"},{"location":"basics/#concepts","text":"A FamiStudio project contains: A list of Songs A list of Instruments A list of DPCM samples Songs are made of Patterns, which are on one of the five Channels supported by the NES.

Configuration Dialog The configuration dialog dialog is accessed from the toolbar. User Interface Configuration Scaling : By default, FamiStudio will use the scaling of your primary monitor on Windows (100%, 150% and 200% are support) and on macOS it will choose between 100% or 200% depending on if you have a retina display or not. This behavior can be overriden by a scaling of your choosing. This requires restarting the app: Time Format : Allow changing the format of the timer in the main toolbar of the application. Check for updates : At startup FamiStudio checks for new version online. This can be disabled. Trackpad controls : Enabling trackpad controls will switch to a control scheme that is better suited for trackpad users: Vertical mouse wheel up/down will scroll up/down instead of zooming in/out. This is the equivalent of swiping your fingers up/down on the trackpad. Horizontal mouse wheel will scroll left/right. This is equivalent of swiping your fingers left/right on the trackpad. Pinch to zoom (or alternatively CTRL + MouseWheel) will zoom in/out. If pinch-to-zoom does not work on Windows, please check your trackpad drivers, this is not an issue with FamiStudio. Note that these are poorly supported on Linux due to the fact that the app uses GTK 2 and gestures are generally poorly supported in Linux. Sound Configuration Stop instrument after : When instruments have release notes, there is no way for FamiStudio to know when to stop the notes. This allows stopping any sound after a specified number of seconds. This only applies to MIDI or when previewing instruments on the piano roll and has no impact on the actual song. Prevent popping on square channels : The NES had a bug where the phase of square channels will reset around some notes (A-3, A-2, D-2, A-1, F-1, D-1, and B-0 on NTSC, or A#3, A#2, D#2, A#1, F#1, D#1, and C-0 on PAL), resulting in audible clicks or pops.

These chips added a few extra audio channels on top of the standard 5 channels. List of expansions supported: Konami VRC6 : Adds 2 square channels and a Sawtooth channel. The square channels are better quality than the stock square as they give more control over the duty cycle and don't suffer for the phase reset bug. Konami VRC7 : Adds 6 FM synthesis channels. It was based off the Yamaha YM2413 OPLL. Qualitatively, it sounds like an old SoundBlaster card from the 90s. It has 15 preset patches and a user-defined one. Since only 1 user-defined patch can be defined, one has to be careful not to use multiple custom patches at the same time from different channels. Famicom Disk System : Adds an extra channel that uses a wavetable and a modulation unit to create a wide range of sound. Nintendo MMC5 : Adds 2 extra square channels. They are extremely similar to the regular square channels of the NES, and also suffer from the same phase reset issue. Unlike the stock square channels, the reset bug cannot be worked around. Namco 163 : Adds up to 8 wavetable channels. It has 128 bytes of RAM to store all the currently used waveforms. Waveforms can be 4, 8, 16 and 32 in size. Smaller waveforms will sound worse, but you can have more of them at any given time. FamiStudio will work at its best with a sample size of 16. Also, it should be noted that for technical reasons, the more channels you add, the worse the audio quality will be. It is recommanded that you use 4 channels or less, which is what most games using the expansion did. Sunsoft S5B : Add 3 extra square channels. These channels are fixed at a duty cycle or 50%. It was based off the Yamaha YM2149F. While this expansion was extremely powerful, it was only ever used in one game (Gimmick!) and this game did not make use of any advanced features of the chip. For this reason, FamiStudio (and most emulator) only support a small subset of features. Enabling expansion audio The expansion audio used is set in the project properties, which you can access by double-clicking on the project name (first row in the Project Explorer). Enabling any kind of expansion audio will automatically disable PAL support. Expansion instruments Almost all expansion audio requires using special instruments on the expansion channels, the only exception being MMC5 because of its similarity with the regular square channels. When you have an expansion enabled and try to create an instrument, you will be asked what time of instrument you want to create. Certain expansion instrument have parameters that are very different from standard instrument. Some of these parameters are accessed by expanding the instrument by clicking on the little triangle on the left of its name. VRC7 VRC7 instruments are by far the ones with the most parameters. Roughly speaking, the chip generates a carier frequency, which is then modified by a modulator. To configure this properly, you should be familiar with the Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release (ADSR) way of generating sound. Patch : Allows you to select one of the built-in patch. Changing any parameter value will revert back to the \"Custom\" patch as it is the only one that can be configured. Carier / Modulator : Tremolo : Toggle use of tremolo. The rate of the tremolo is fixed and cannot be changed. Vibrato : Toggle use of vibrato. The rate of the vibrato is fixed and cannot be changed. Sustained : Toggle use of sustain in the envelope. Wave Rectified : If enabled, clips the waveform to zero. Key Scaling : Toggle use of the KeyScaling Level parameter. KeyScaling Level : Affects the speed of the ADSR envelope speed. FreqMultiplier : Multiplier on the frequency. Attack : Speed of the attack. Decay : Speed of the decay. Sustain : Attenuation after decay. Release : Speed of release. Modulator Level : Output level of the modulator. Feedback : Feedback applied to the modulator. Famicom Disk System The FDS instruments have 2 extra envelopes and a few extra parameter. The extra envelopes are: Waveform : The waveform of the instrument. It has a fixed length of 64 and can be fully customized. You can also choose from one of the presets. Modulation Table : The modulation table is used to modulate the waveform. It has a fixed length of 32 and can be fully customized. You can also choose from one of the presets. It has no effect if the modulation speed or depth is zero. Note that the way the modulation table is edited is very different from FamiTracker. All the internal complexity is hidden. The parameters are: Master Volume : At full volume the FDS can be significantly louder than the regular channels. The chip also supported 40%, 50% and 66% which makes the sound a lot more balanced. Wave Preset : A few preset that you can use to set the waveform envelope. Mod Preset : A few preset that you can use to set the modulation envelope. Mod Speed : The speed of the modulation. Mod Depth : The depth of the modulation. Mod Delay : A delay, in frames (1/60th of a second) before enabling modulation. When changing the values of the sliders with huge values (such as the Mod Speed), you can hold Shift while dragging to fine tune the exact value. Namco 163 The N163 instruments have an extra envelope and a few extra parameter. Note that FamiStudio's current implementation of N163 only supports a single waveform per instrument, unlike FamiTracker which has many. Extra envelope: Waveform : The waveform of the instrument. It will of a fixed length, as speficied by the \"Wave Size\" parameter. The parameters are: Wave Preset : A few preset that you can use to set the waveform envelope. Wave Size : The N163 chip had only 128 of RAM to store all the waveforms used at any given time. For example, if you use waveforms of size 32, you can only use 4 unique instrument at any given time. Using more will result in channels using wrong instruments. Wave Position : The position, in the 128 bytes of memory, of the waveform. You must manually make sure that different waveforms dont overlap.","title":"Using Expansion Audio"},{"location":"expansion/#using-expansion-audio","text":"","title":"Using Expansion Audio"},{"location":"expansion/#overview","text":"Expansion audio refers to extra hardware that were present on some NES cartridges (or add-on in the case of the Famicom Disk System). These chips added a few extra audio channels on top of the standard 5 channels. List of expansions supported: Konami VRC6 : Adds 2 square channels and a Sawtooth channel. The square channels are better quality than the stock square as they give more control over the duty cycle and don't suffer for the phase reset bug. Konami VRC7 : Adds 6 FM synthesis channels.

Wave File Only a single song can be exported at a time. You can choose the sample rate, it is recommended to stick to 44.1KHz if you want the sound to be exactly as you hear it in FamiStudio. Lower sample rate might lack high frequencies. The song can be exported in one of two modes: * Play Once : Will play the song until the end, ignoring the loop point. * Duration : Will loop though the song for the specified number of seconds. Channels can optionally be muted. This can be used, for example, to create stereo mix using and external application. Nintendo Sound Format Every feature supported by FamiStudio can be used in an NSF. Song that do not use any audio expansion can export as PAL and Dual mode, where as only NTSC is available for expansion audio. The maximum song size is approximately 28KB minus the size of the DPCM samples used. Note that this size are not printed anywhere and are not related to the size of the *.fms file. Best to simply try and see if it works. ROM Song(s) can be exported to a NES ROM file to play if back on an emulator or on actual hardware. The current iteration uses Mapper 31 which is supported by most emulators and the Everdrive N8 . You can then copy the ROM to an SD card and listen to it on actual hardware. Note that expansion audio is not supported with this mapper. The user interface is very simple, pressing left/right on the D-PAD will change the current track. Track/song names will be truncated to 28 characters. For something a lot more customizable, check out EZNSF by Brad Smith. FamiTracker Text You can export songs to FamiTracker using their Text Export format. There are some limitations: Pitch envelopes with looping sections will be modified on export so that the looping part sums to zero. This is done to prevent pitch from drifting up/down every time the envelope loops. The reason for this is that FamiTracker's pitch envelopes are relative while FamiStudio's are absolute. Instruments using both pitch and arpeggio envelopes at the same time will not sound correct in FamiTracker. This is due to the vastly different way both applications handles these. FamiTracker re-triggers the pitch envelope at each arpeggio notes (probably the more sensible way), while FamiStudio simply runs both at the same time. For slide notes, FamiStudio will do its very best to choose which FamiTracker effect to use. Note that importing/exporting slide notes with FamiTracker should be considered a lossy process. Here are the general rules: If the slide note and its target are within 16 semitones, Qxx/Rxx (note slide up/down) will be favored as it is the most similar effect to what we are doing. Otherwise, if the previous note has the same pitch as the slide note, 3xx (auto-portamento) will be used. Finally, if none of these conditions are satisfied, 1xx/2xx (slide up/down) will be used. This is not ideal since the pitch might not exactly match the target note. Slide notes of VRC7 will definitely not export perfectly due to the different way in which both applications handle VRC7 pitches. VRC6 saw channel is not influenced by duty cycle in FamiStudio. FamiStudio always allow the full volume range for the saw. Import/export process does not try account for this. This might lead to volume inconsistencies between FamiTracker and FamiStudio where the volume needs to be doubled or halved to sound correct. Vibrato effect might sound slightly different once exported to FamiTracker. The speed values in FamiStudio are slightly different than FamiTracker. Here is a table relating the speeds in FamiStudio and FamiTracker (this is applied automatically when importing/exporting): FamiTracker speed FamiTracker period FamiStudio speed FamiStudio period 1 64 1 64 2 32 2 32 3 21.3 3 21 4 16 4 16 5 12.8 5 13 6 10.7 6 11 7 9.1 7 9 8 8 8 8 9 7.1 9 7 10 6.4 10 6 11 5.8 10 6 12 5.3 11 5 13 4.9 11 5 14 4.6 11 5 15 4.3 12 4 FamiStudio Text FamiStudio text format is a textual representation of the of the binary FamiStudio format. It is designed to favor interopability with other softwares, tools and sound engines. Exporting or importing this mostly lossless. The only this not stored in this format are the custom colors assigned to instruments, patterns and songs (they will be randomized every time you re-import the file). Format Specification The format describe one object per line followed by some attributes and values. Attribute are always between double-quotes. All indentation is purely cosmetic. Object Attribute1=\"Value1\" Attribute2=\"Value2\" The general structure of a file has these objects nested like this: Project : The root of the file. DPCMSample : A DPCM sample DPCMMapping : Maps a piano key to a DPCMSample. Instrument : An instrument Envelope : One envelope of an instrument Song : A song PatternCustomSettings : Custom length or tempo settings of a pattern column. Channel : A channel of the NES (or audio expansion) Pattern : A short part of the song that can be repeated. Note : A note inside a pattern. PatternInstance : An instance (copy) of a pattern at a specific time.

It will generate assembly code that can be included in your homebrew project and played using the FamiTone2 sound engine. When exporting file in separate files, you can specific a name format template for each song. The {project} and {song} macros are available. When exporting as a single file (non-separate), you will be prompt to name the output assembly file. If any of the exported songs uses DPCM samples, a .dmc file of the same name will also be outputted. If you are using the FamiStudio tempo mode and wish to have correct PAL playback in you homebrew game, please check out this custom version of FamiTone2 (named FamiTone2FS) that supports it: https://github.com/BleuBleu/FamiTone2FS FamiTone2 Sound Effect The same goes for sound effect export. It should work very similarly as original FamiTone 2 tools provided by Shiru. In this mode, one song is one sound effect, so songs should be very short. Unlike the FamiTone2 music format which only support a subset of all the FamiTracker/FamiStudio features, here any feature (except DPCM samples) can be used and the sound effect should export correctly. Importing Songs To import songs, simply open a file. On Windows it is also possible drag & drop a file in the application. FamiTracker Text or Binary Import from FamiTracker (official 0.4.6 only) is supported through the text (TXT file) or binary format (FTM file). Note that only a small subset of features is supported. Only the following effects are supported. Every other effect will be ignored: 1xx/2xx (Slide up/down) : Will be converted to slide notes 3xx (Portamento) : Will be converted to slide notes. 4xy (Vibrato) : Vibrator speed will be slightly modified, see table above for mapping. Bxx (Jump) : Will be converted to loop point. Dxx (Skip) : Will be converted to a custom pattern length. Fxx (Speed) : Only speed is supported. Pxx (Fine pitch) : Fully supported. Hxx (FDS Modulation depth) : Fully supported. Ixx/Jxx (FDS Modulation speed) : Fully supported, but combined in one 16-bit value. Besides effects, there are also other limitations: When the limit of 16KB is reached, all subsequent DPCM samples will stop loading. Namco 163 instrument can only have a single waveform. Any other waveform than zero will be ignored. Namco 163 instrument only support wave size 4, 8, 16 and 32 and wave positions that are multiples of these sizes. Other values might lead to undefined behaviors. VRC7 1xx/2xx/3xx/Qxx/Rxx effects will likely not sound like FamiTracker and will need manual corrections. Instruments using both pitch and arpeggio envelopes at the same time will not sound the same as in FamiTracker. This is due to the vastly different way both applications handles these. FamiTracker re-triggers the pitch envelope at each arpeggio notes (probably the more sensible way), while FamiStudio simply runs both at the same time.

This might lead to volume inconsistencies between FamiTracker and FamiStudio where the volume needs to be doubled or halved to sound correct. Vibrato effect might sound a bit different, please see table above for exact mappings. When importing from FamiTracker, all possible slide effects (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, Qxx and Rxx) will be converted to slide notes. Sometimes attack will be disabled as well to mimic the same behavior. This in an inherently imperfect process since they approaches are so different. For this reason, importing/exporting slide notes with FamiTracker should be considered a lossy process. FamiStudio Text The FamiStudio text format is support, please see the documentation above for the format specification. Nintendo Sound Format NSF (and NSFE) files can be imported in FamiStudio. This includes NSF with expansion audio. When opening and NSF file, you will be presented a dialog box. You will need to chose the song to import and specify a duration (in sec) to extract from the NSF. Most NSF file will not contain the names of songs so they will usually have placeholder names. NSF file are essentially programs designed to run on actual hardware. They will contain no instrument, no envelopes, no repeating pattern, etc. All the volumes and pitches will be set through the effect panel. They are going to appear extremely messy and unoptimized. That being said, NSF can still be extremely useful to reverse engineer how songs were made. In fact, this is how most of the Demo Songs that come with FamiStudio were made. In the example below, we can imagine that the notes on the right were all using the same instrument with a decreasing volume envelope. The notes of the left were clearly using a vibrato effect or a pitch envelope. Only features that are supported by FamiStudio will be imported. Things like hardware sweeps & advanced DPCM manipulations will all be ignored.","title":"Importing & Exporting Your Songs"},{"location":"importexport/#exporting-songs","text":"The export dialog is access through the main toolbar.","title":"Exporting Songs"},{"location":"importexport/#wave-file","text":"Only a single song can be exported at a time.

Any other waveform than zero will be ignored. Namco 163 instrument only support wave size 4, 8, 16 and 32 and wave positions that are multiples of these sizes. Other values might lead to undefined behaviors. VRC7 1xx/2xx/3xx/Qxx/Rxx effects will likely not sound like FamiTracker and will need manual corrections. Instruments using both pitch and arpeggio envelopes at the same time will not sound the same as in FamiTracker. This is due to the vastly different way both applications handles these. FamiTracker re-triggers the pitch envelope at each arpeggio notes (probably the more sensible way), while FamiStudio simply runs both at the same time. VRC6 saw channel is not influenced by duty cycle in FamiStudio. FamiStudio always allow the full volume range for the saw. Import/export process does not try account for this. This might lead to volume inconsistencies between FamiTracker and FamiStudio where the volume needs to be doubled or halved to sound correct. Vibrato effect might sound a bit different, please see table above for exact mappings. When importing from FamiTracker, all possible slide effects (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, Qxx and Rxx) will be converted to slide notes. Sometimes attack will be disabled as well to mimic the same behavior.

Relative pitch : By default, FamiStudio's pitch envelope are absolute. Meaning that the envelope values are the pitch you are going to hear, this is especially useful for vibrato where you can draw a simple sine wave. It is sometimes useful to have relative pitch envelope to create pitches that rapidly ascend or decend (useful for bassdrum sounds). This is how FamiTracker handles pitch envelopes. Adding instruments You can an instrument by pressing the \"+\" sign, and you can one by right-clicking on it. Deleting an instrument will delete all notes used by that instrument. Replacing an instrument by another Clicking on an instrument name and dragging it over another instrument will allow you to replace all notes of the first instrument by the second. This is useful prior to deleting an instrument. Importing instruments You can import intruments in your project from any supported input format, as well as FamiTracker instrument files (FTI files, official FamiTracker 0.4.6 only) by clicking the little folder icon. When importing instruments from another project or a FamiTracker file, you will be prompted with a list of instruments to import. Simply check the instrument to bring over. Note that instruments that are using incompatible expansion audio will not be able to be imported. Also, instruments with the same names are assumed to be the same. If you project already contains an instrument called \"Piano\" and you try to import another one called \"Piano\", nothing will happen. You are responsible to uniquely name your instruments if they are truly different. Editing instrument envelopes Clicking on an envelope icon in the project explorer will open the envelope of that instrument in the piano roll. The length of the envelope can be changed by left-clicking (and potentially dragging) in the timeline of the piano roll. Setting the length of an envelope to zero will disable it. The loop point of an envelope can be set by right-clicking in the timeline. Volume tracks are also allowed to have release envelopes. Release envelopes are played when a release note is encountered and terminates the loop by jumping to the release point. This is useful for fading out notes smoothly. The release point is set by right-dragging from the rightmost side of the envelope. Copying envelope values Right-clicking on the numbers on the header of the envelope editor allows for range selection of envelope values. These can then be copy and pasted elsewhere. It is also possible to paste envelope values coming for raw text. Any series of number that is space, tab, comma, semicolon or newline separated can be pasted in the envelope editor. Copying envelopes Clicking on an envelope button and dragging it on another instrument will copy that envelope from the first to the second. Note that unlike FamiTracker, envelopes are not explicitly shared between instruments. Identical envelopes will be combined when exporting to FamiTone2, but it is your responsibility to optimize the content and ensure that you limit the number of unique envelopes. Deleting envelopes Right-clicking on the icon of an envelope deletes it. Editing DPCM samples Clicking on the little icon next to the DPCM samples in the project explorer will open the piano roll in DPCM edition mode. Clicking anywhere on a note that does not have a DPCM sample associated will prompt you to open a .DMC file. No DMC edition tool is provided, you can use FamiTracker , RJDMC or any other tool.

You can also use it to preview instrument by clicking on the keyboard. The currently selected instrument (in the project explorer) will play on the currently selected channel (in the sequencer). Subdivision Horizontal lines in the piano rolls are align with the notes of the piano. The vertical lines represents multiple levels of subdivisions: Thick black lines seperate patterns (not shown in this image) Thin black lines seperate bars (a bar is a simple group of notes, purely a visual aid) Thin gray lines seperate notes Thin dashes gray lines seperate individual NTSC frames, 1/60th of a sec. (FamiStudio tempo mode only) In FamiTracker tempo mode, you do not have access to the individual frames, so the dashes lines will not be visible. Seeking Clicking in the timeline (header) of the piano roll will move the play position. Adding and deleting notes Clicking a pattern in the sequencer will scroll the piano roll to its location. Left-clicking in the piano roll will add a note of the currently selected instrument. Holding the mouse when clicking will allow you to drag the note and will give audio feedback. You cannot add a note where the is not a pattern created. Right-clicking deletes a note. Snapping Snapping can be toggle by clicking the little magnet in the top-left corner of the piano roll. SHIFT+S can also be used to quickly toggle snapping on/off. The precision of the snapping can be changed by left/right clicking the number of using the mousewheel over the number or magnet icon. Using FamiStudio tempo mode will allow you to use both fractional snapping (1/4, 1/3, 1/2) and integer snapping (1, 2, 3, 4). FamiTracker tempo mode is limited to integer snapping since it does not give you full control over the individual frames. Fractional snapping will perform rounding when the number of frames in a note isnt exactly divisible by the precision. Adding, selecting and dragging of notes are currently the only actions affected by snapping. More might be added in future based on user feedback. Stop & Release notes Using Ctrl+click will add a stop note. Stops notes are displayed as little triangles. Although they are displayed next to the note preceding them, they actually have no pitch or instrument, they simply stop the sound. Stop notes are important because on the NES, a note will play indefinitely unless you tell it to stop. Using Shift+click will add a release notes. Release notes are shown as making the note thinner and triggers the envelope to jump to the release point. Release envelopes are useful to nicely fade out a note when its release, while preserving other effects like vibrato. There is no point to adding a release note to an instrument that does not have a release envelope. Hovering the mouse in the piano roll will display the location and note in the toolbar. Hovering over a note will display which instrument it uses. Note attack By default, notes will have an \"attack\" which mean they will restart their envelopes (volume, pitch, etc.) from the beginning. This is represented by the little dark rectangle on the left of each note. This can be toggled for a particular note by hold the A key and clicking on a note. Note that if a note does not use the same instrument as the previous one, the attack will still play, even if disabled. Also please note that this will generally not carry over to FamiTracker, besides specific use cases around slide notes. In this example, the first note will have an attack, while the second one will not. Since envelopes are not resetted, this means that if a note was released, it will remain released if the subsequent notes have no attack. Slide notes Slide notes are notes that start at a given pitch (the pitch of the note) and slowly change to hit a target pitch which is represented by where the triangle ends. In this example, the attack of the second note has been disabled. Slide notes garantees that the target pitch will be reached by the end of the note (end of the triangle) but this might happen a bit earlier than the visual repesentation suggests. Especially in the higher pitches. This is due to the fact that the pitch calculations are all integer-based (with 1-bit of fraction) and it is often impossible to get the exact required slope to reach the pitch at the exact time. Selecting and editing notes You can select notes by right-clicking and dragging in the header of the piano roll. Selected notes will appear with a thick silver border. Once notes are selected, then can be moved using the arrows keys (up, down, left and right). Holding CTRL while doing so will make the notes move by larger increments. Cutting, copying and pasting notes Much like the sequencer, selcted notes can be copy (or cut) by pressing CTRL+C (or CTRL+X). You can then move the selection somewhere else and paste the notes with CTRL+V. Special paste If you want to paste notes, without their associated effets or volume track (or vice-versa). You can use a \"special paste\" by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+V. This will open a popup dialog asking you to choose what you want to paste. The default behavior of pasting is to completely replace everything by the content of the clipboard. Using the \"Mix with existing notes\" option will preserve any existing data (notes, volumes, effects) and only insert new data if there is nothing there already. Copy & pasting notes between projects It is possible to copy notes from one project to another. When doing so, FamiStudio will first look to make sure the instruments used by these notes exist in the other project. It will look for instruments having the same name . If some instruments are not found in the second project, it will offer you to create them for you, thus bringing the instrument from one project to another. For example, if you copy a note from project 1 using an instrument called \"Piano\", FamiStudio will look for an instrument named \"Piano\" in the second. If it finds one, it will assume it is the same (even though it might not be). If no \"Piano\" instrument is found, it will offer you to create it for you. This can be used as a way of transfering instruments from one project to another. Place a few notes using all the instruments you can to transfer. Copy them and paste them in the second project. Editing volume tracks & effects The effect panel can be opened by clicking the little triangle at the top-left of the piano roll. Right now, only a handful of effects are supported: Volume : The overall volume of the channel. Vib Speed : Vibrato speed, used in conjuction with vibrato depth to create a vibrato effect. Vib Depth : Vibrato depth, used in conjuction with vibrato speed to create a vibrato effect. Pitch : Allow tweaking the fine-pitch of a channel. FDS Speed : Famicom Disk System audio modulation speed (FDS audio expansion only). FDS Depth : Famicom Disk System audio modulation depth (FDS audio expansion only). Speed : Changes the speed of the song (FamiTracker tempo mode only) Effects are edited by selecting and effect and dragging up or down to change the value. Right-clicking on an effect value deletes it. For effects that have huge values (such as FDS Depth), you can hold Shift to fine tune the exact value (a movement of 1 pixel will change the value by 1). Volume track The volume tracks dictates how loud the current channel should play. This volume is combined with volume envelope by multiplication (50% volume track x 50% envelope volume = 25% total volume). It is much more efficient to use volume envelopes wherever possible and only use volume tracks to control the global volume of the song. Vibrato depth & speed. Vibrato depth and speed are used to add vibrato to a portion of the song without having to bother creating a new instrument. Please note that vibrato will temporarely override any pitch envelope on the current instrument. When vibrato is disabled (by setting depth or speed, or both to zero), the instrument will essentially have no pitch envelope until a new note is played. The depth values for the vibrato are indentical to FamiTracker but the speeds are slightly different. The way FamiTracker implements vibrato, while clever, is flawed as it undersamples the vibrato curve at high speed, leading to aliasing which ends up with a low-frequency tone that has a \"ringing\" sound to it. Please see the Import/Export for a table that maps between FamiStudio and FamiTracker. Pitch Controls the global pitch of the track. Can be used to make an entire channel slightly out of tune.","title":"Editing Notes"},{"location":"pianoroll/#editing-notes","text":"The Piano Roll is where you editing the actual notes of the song, the instrument envelopes, as well as some special effects.

Also please note that this will generally not carry over to FamiTracker, besides specific use cases around slide notes.

Tempo Modes The tempo mode will affect how the tempo of you songs is calculated, how much control you have over the notes of your song and how your song plays on PAL systems. Note that changing the tempo mode when you have songs created is possible, but not recommended, the conversion is quite crude at the moment. FamiStudio supports two tempo modes : FamiTracker and FamiStudio , this handy table will summarize the differences between the 2 tempo modes. FamiTracker Tempo FamiStudio Tempo Granularity Maximum precision is dictated by the speed parameter. Anything finer has to use effects which operate at a frame-level. Very few FamiTracker effects are supported. Gives control over every frame (1/60th or 1/50th or a second). Paradigm Makes a lot of sense in a tracker where information density is important. Makes a lot of sense in a DAW where simply zooming in/out can reveal more detail. Editing Mostly machine-agnostic when it comes to editing. Your are not explicitely making the song in PAL or NTSC, except for some effects like delayed notes/cuts, slides, etc. which makes assumption on the duration of a frame. You are explicitely editing in NTSC or PAL space. Playback Playback to NTSC or PAL is done by changing the speed at which the internal counter is incremented. This breaks down at low speed values. Playback to NTSC or PAL is done by either running the sound engine twice (when playing NTSC song on PAL) or idling (when running a PAL song on NTSC) at strategically chosen frames. The frames where where skipping/idling can happen are deterministic. Support Will no longuer receive any improvement in FamiStudio Will keep improving in the future. Compatiblity Better suited if you need to export to FamiTracker Will export to FamiTracker, but at a speed of 1, tempo 150. FamiStudio tempo mode (default) In this mode, you always have control over every single frame (1/60th of a second in NTSC, 1/50th in PAL). You will be able to choose a Note Length which has a fixed number a frames. More frames means a slower tempo. Unlike FamiTracker tempo which is (mostly) machine-agnostic when it comes to editing, in FamiStudio tempo, your project is authored for a specific machine (NTSC or PAL) and a conversion is applied at playback if necessary (PAL playing on NTSC or vice-versa). One of the big different with FamiTracker tempo is in the way it handles PAL to NTSC or NTSC to PAL conversion. NTSC to PAL For example, in the image below, we have a NTSC song with 6 frames (1/60th of a sec) per note. On PAL system (50 FPS), if were were to play back this song, it would play 20% slower. To faitfully play back our NTSC song on PAL systems, FamiStudio will sometimes run 2 NTSC frames in a single PAL frame so it can keep up with NTSC. This makes the playback speed almost the same, but unfortunately, this is not always this simple. Let's take a note length of 8 frames for example. Again, if we were to try to naively play this back on PAL, it would play back 20% slower than NTSC. If we try to apply the same strategy of running 2 NTSC frame once per note, we would still end up playing 5% slower. The solution here is to skip 4 NTSC frames, over 3 notes to distribute the error. This ends up reduce the playback speed error well below 1%. This table sumarizes the number of frames that will be skipped on PAL for different note length. Number of NTSC frames (1/60 sec) Number of frames skipped by PAL Positions of potential double-frames BPM 1 1 double frames over 6 notes 1 900.0 2 1 double frames over 3 notes 01 450.0 3 1 double frames over 2 notes 010 300.0 4 2 double frames over 3 notes 0100 225.0 5 5 double frames over 6 notes 01000 180.0 6 1 double frames over 1 notes 010000 150.0 7 7 double frames over 6 notes 0100010 128.6 8 4 double frames over 3 notes 01000100 112.5 9 3 double frames over 2 notes 010001000 100.0 10 5 double frames over 3 notes 0100001000 90.0 11 11 double frames over 6 notes 01000001000 81.8 12 2 double frames over 1 notes 010000010000 75.0 13 13 double frames over 6 notes 0100010001000 69.2 14 7 double frames over 3 notes 01000100001000 64.3 15 5 double frames over 2 notes 010000100001000 60.0 16 8 double frames over 3 notes 0100001000010000 56.3 17 17 double frames over 6 notes 01000001000001000 52.9 18 3 double frames over 1 notes 010000010000010000 50.0 PAL to NTSC The sample principle apply when playing PAL songs on NTSC, but instead of running 2 frames rapidly, the sound engine will simply \"do nothing\" (idle) every once in a while to avoid going too fast.

Composite notes Note that you arent not limited to the BPM values suggested by the different note lengths. You can create in-between ones by putting multiples notes into a larger one. For example, Gimmick! uses a 11 frames per note, but puts 2 notes inside it. One of 5 frames and one of 6 frames. This creates an approximate tempo of 163.6 BPM and the different note lengths is not audible. The FamiTracker documentation has a handy chart for these. Note that you are limited to 18 frames per note a the moment. FamiTone2 support of FamiStudio tempo mode If you are using the FamiStudio tempo mode and wish to have correct PAL playback in you homebrew game, please check out this custom version of FamiTone2 (named FamiTone2FS) that supports it: https://github.com/BleuBleu/FamiTone2FS FamiTracker tempo mode This mode is mostly for compatibility with FamiTracker. It uses the speed/tempo paradigm. Please check out the FamiTracker documentation for a detailed explanation on how the playback speed is affected. If you import a FamiTracker Text or FTM file, it will be in this tempo mode. Only use this mode if you have specific compatibility needs with FamiTracker (such as exporting to an audio engine that only supports this tempo mode), as it will not receive any future improvement. When using this tempo mode, the Speed effect will be available in the effect panel. Delayed notes and delayed cuts are not supported and will likely never be as they are inherentely a tracker-centric feature. Editing song properties Double-clicking on the a song will allow you to change its name, color and other attributes. Names must be unique. This dialog will look very different depending on the Tempo Mode of the current project. FamiStudio Tempo FamiTracker tempo Common properties: Song length : The number of patterns in the song Notes Per Pattern : Default number of notes in a pattern. Pattern length can be customized on a per-pattern basis in the Sequencer. Notes Per Bar : Number of notes in a bar. The piano roll will draw a darker line at every bar. Simply a visual aid, does not affect the audio in any way Properties unique FamiTracker tempo mode: Speed : How much the timer is increment each frame, values other than 150 might create uneven notes Tempo : How many frames to wait before advancing to the next note (at least when using the integral tempo or 150) Properties unique FamiStudio tempo mode: Frames Per Notes : How many frames (1/60th) in a typical notes. Values between 5 and 16 are recommended as they create the least error on PAL system.

Only use this mode if you have specific compatibility needs with FamiTracker (such as exporting to an audio engine that only supports this tempo mode), as it will not receive any future improvement.

Values between 5 and 16 are recommended as they create the least error on PAL system.
