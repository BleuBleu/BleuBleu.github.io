Patterns contain Notes which are played by an Instrument (DPCM samples do not require an instrument). Instruments may have some of their attributes (pitch, volume, arpeggio) modulated by Envelopes. Most of the operations are performed with the mouse. In general: The left mouse button adds stuff, double-clicking something edits properties (songs, patterns, instruments, DPCM) The right mouse button removes stuff. Right clicking in the header of the Sequencer or Piano Roll selects. The middle mouse button pans when you press it and zooms and you use the mouse wheel. If you are working on a trackpad, all actions requiring pressing the middle mouse buttons can be done with Alt+Left click. Main Window The UI was designed to be a simple as possible, there are almost no context menus. The main window has 4 main components: The Toolbar (on top) The Project Explorer (on the right) is where you add/remove/edit songs and instruments. The Sequencer (below the toolbar) is where you schedule your patterns on one of the 5 channels. It gives a high-level view of the song. The Piano Roll (below the sequencer) is where you edit your patterns. At any given moment there is always: A selected channel, in bold in the sequencer A selected song, in bold in the project explorer song list A selected instrument, in bold in the project explorer instrument list. The sequencer and piano roll will display the information for the currently selected song. When pressing the keys on the piano roll, it will play notes for the currently selected instrument, and output it on the currently selected channel. The same applies if you have a MIDI keyboard connected. Toolbar The main toolbar contains your usual stuff: file operation, undo/redo, timecode and play control. Tooltip Keyboard shortcuts or special actions are always displayed as tooltips in the upper-right corner of the toolbar. Please keep an eye on it to learn new functionalities. Playing/pausing the song Besides the toolbar, space bar is used to play/pause the song. Ctrl-space plays in pattern loop mode, Shift-space plays in song loop mode. Changing the looping mode There are 3 looping modes: Song : loops the entire song Pattern : loops at the end of the current pattern None : stops at the end of the song Saving the project Clicking on the icon save the project, right-clicking is a \"save as...\" and will prompt you for a new filename. Exporting to various formats Please see the Import/Export section for details on how to export to various formats. Cleanup dialog Please see the Cleanup section for details on how to cleanup your project. Configuration dialog Please see the Configuration section for details on how to configure FamiStudio. Project Explorer The project explorer displays the list of songs and instruments in the current project. For more details on what you can do with the Project Explorer, please check out these sections: * Editing Songs & Project * Editing Instruments Sequencer The sequencer is where you organize the high-level structure of the song: which patterns play and when they play. The thumbnails of the patterns in the sequencer are by no mean accurate. Please visit the Editing Patterns section for more details. Piano Roll The piano roll is where you editing the actual notes of the song, the instrument envelopes, as well as some special effects. Please check out the Editing Notes section for more details. Keyboard shortcuts Here is a list of useful keyboard shortcuts: Space : Play/stop the stop Ctrl+Space : Plays from beginning of current pattern and switch to pattern loop mode. Shift+Space : Plays from current position and reverts back to song loop mode and Home : Seeks back to beginning of the song. Ctrl+Home : Seeks to beginning of the current pattern. Esc : Stops any stop, clears the selection. Ctrl+Z : Undo Ctrl+Y : Redo Ctrl+N : New project Ctrl+S : Save Ctrl+E : Export Ctrl+O : Open Delete : Delete selected patterns or notes.

Configuration Dialog The configuration dialog dialog is accessed from the toolbar. User Interface Configuration Scaling : By default, FamiStudio will use the scaling of your primary monitor on Windows (100%, 150% and 200% are support) and on macOS it will choose between 100% or 200% depending on if you have a retina display or not. This behavior can be overriden by a scaling of your choosing. This requires restarting the app. Check for updates : At startup FamiStudio checks for new version online. This can be disabled. Sound Configuration Stop instrument after : When instruments have release notes, there is no way for FamiStudio to know when to stop the notes. This allows stopping any sound after a specified number of seconds. This only applies to MIDI or when previewing instruments on the piano roll and has no impact on the actual song. Prevent popping on square channels : The NES had a bug where the phase of square channels will reset around some notes (A-3, A-2, D-2, A-1, F-1, D-1, and B-0 on NTSC, or A#3, A#2, D#2, A#1, F#1, D#1, and C-0 on PAL), resulting in audible clicks or pops.

These chips added a few extra audio channels on top of the standard 5 channels. List of expansions supported: Konami VRC6 : Adds 2 square channels and a Sawtooth channel. The square channels are better quality than the stock square as they give more control over the duty cycle and don't suffer for the phase reset bug. Konami VRC7 : Adds 6 FM synthesis channels. It was based off the Yamaha YM2413 OPLL. Qualitatively, it sounds like an old SoundBlaster card from the 90s. It has 15 preset patches and a user-defined one. Since only 1 user-defined patch can be defined, one has to be careful not to use multiple custom patches at the same time from different channels. Famicom Disk System : Adds an extra channel that uses a wavetable and a modulation unit to create a wide range of sound. Nintendo MMC5 : Adds 2 extra square channels. They are extremely similar to the regular square channels of the NES, and also suffer from the same phase reset issue. Unlike the stock square channels, the reset bug cannot be worked around. Namco 163 : Adds up to 8 wavetable channels. It has 128 bytes of RAM to store all the currently used waveforms. Waveforms can be 4, 8, 16 and 32 in size. Smaller waveforms will sound worse, but you can have more of them at any given time. FamiStudio will work at its best with a sample size of 16. Also, it should be noted that for technical reasons, the more channels you add, the worse the audio quality will be. It is recommanded that you use 4 channels or less, which is what most games using the expansion did. Sunsoft S5B : Add 3 extra square channels. These channels are fixed at a duty cycle or 50%. It was based off the Yamaha YM2149F. While this expansion was extremely powerful, it was only ever used in one game (Gimmick!) and this game did not make use of any advanced features of the chip. For this reason, FamiStudio (and most emulator) only support a small subset of features. Enabling expansion audio The expansion audio used is set in the project properties, which you can access by double-clicking on the project name (first row in the Project Explorer). Enabling any kind of expansion audio will automatically disable PAL support. Expansion instruments Almost all expansion audio requires using special instruments on the expansion channels, the only exception being MMC5 because of its similarity with the regular square channels. When you have an expansion enabled and try to create an instrument, you will be asked what time of instrument you want to create. Certain expansion instrument have parameters that are very different from standard instrument. Some of these parameters are accessed by expanding the instrument by clicking on the little triangle on the left of its name. VRC7 VRC7 instruments are by far the ones with the most parameters. Roughly speaking, the chip generates a carier frequency, which is then modified by a modulator. To configure this properly, you should be familiar with the Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release (ADSR) way of generating sound. Patch : Allows you to select one of the built-in patch. Changing any parameter value will revert back to the \"Custom\" patch as it is the only one that can be configured. Carier / Modulator : Tremolo : Toggle use of tremolo. The rate of the tremolo is fixed and cannot be changed. Vibrato : Toggle use of vibrato. The rate of the vibrato is fixed and cannot be changed. Sustained : Toggle use of sustain in the envelope. Wave Rectified : If enabled, clips the waveform to zero. Key Scaling : Toggle use of the KeyScaling Level parameter. KeyScaling Level : Affects the speed of the ADSR envelope speed. FreqMultiplier : Multiplier on the frequency. Attack : Speed of the attack. Decay : Speed of the decay. Sustain : Attenuation after decay. Release : Speed of release. Modulator Level : Output level of the modulator. Feedback : Feedback applied to the modulator. Famicom Disk System The FDS instruments have 2 extra envelopes and a few extra parameter. The extra envelopes are: Waveform : The waveform of the instrument. It has a fixed length of 64 and can be fully customized. You can also choose from one of the presets. Modulation Table : The modulation table is used to modulate the waveform. It has a fixed length of 32 and can be fully customized. You can also choose from one of the presets. It has no effect if the modulation speed or depth is zero. Note that the way the modulation table is edited is very different from FamiTracker. All the internal complexity is hidden. The parameters are: Master Volume : At full volume the FDS can be significantly louder than the regular channels. The chip also supported 40%, 50% and 66% which makes the sound a lot more balanced. Wave Preset : A few preset that you can use to set the waveform envelope. Mod Preset : A few preset that you can use to set the modulation envelope. Mod Speed : The speed of the modulation. Mod Depth : The depth of the modulation. Mod Delay : A delay, in frames (1/60th of a second) before enabling modulation. When changing the values of the sliders with huge values (such as the Mod Speed), you can hold Shift while dragging to fine tune the exact value. Namco 163 The N163 instruments have an extra envelope and a few extra parameter. Note that FamiStudio's current implementation of N163 only supports a single waveform per instrument, unlike FamiTracker which has many. Extra envelope: Waveform : The waveform of the instrument. It will of a fixed length, as speficied by the \"Wave Size\" parameter. The parameters are: Wave Preset : A few preset that you can use to set the waveform envelope. Wave Size : The N163 chip had only 128 of RAM to store all the waveforms used at any given time. For example, if you use waveforms of size 32, you can only use 4 unique instrument at any given time. Using more will result in channels using wrong instruments. Wave Position : The position, in the 128 bytes of memory, of the waveform. You must manually make sure that different waveforms dont overlap.","title":"Using Expansion Audio"},{"location":"expansion/#using-expansion-audio","text":"","title":"Using Expansion Audio"},{"location":"expansion/#overview","text":"Expansion audio refers to extra hardware that were present on some NES cartridges (or add-on in the case of the Famicom Disk System).

When changing the values of the sliders with huge values (such as the Mod Speed), you can hold Shift while dragging to fine tune the exact value.","title":"Famicom Disk System"},{"location":"expansion/#namco-163","text":"The N163 instruments have an extra envelope and a few extra parameter.

Wave Size : The N163 chip had only 128 of RAM to store all the waveforms used at any given time. For example, if you use waveforms of size 32, you can only use 4 unique instrument at any given time. Using more will result in channels using wrong instruments. Wave Position : The position, in the 128 bytes of memory, of the waveform. You must manually make sure that different waveforms dont overlap.","title":"Namco 163"},{"location":"importexport/","text":"Exporting Songs The export dialog is access through the main toolbar. Wave File Only a single song can be exported at a time. You can choose the sample rate, it is recommended to stick to 44.1KHz if you want the soung to be exactly as you hear it in FamiStudio. Lower sample rate might lack high frequencies. When exporting to WAV, the song will simply play once fully, all jump effects will be ignored. Nintendo Sound Format Every feature supported by FamiStudio can be used in an NSF. Song that do not use any audio expansion can export as PAL and Dual mode, where as only NTSC is available for expansion audio. The maximum song sizet is approximately 28KB minus the size of the DPCM samples used. Note that this size are not printed anywhere and are not related to the size of the *.fms file. Best to simply try and see if it works. ROM Song(s) can be exported to a NES ROM file to play if back on an emulator or on actual hardware. The current iteration uses Mapper 31 which is supported by most emulators and the Everdrive N8 . You can then copy the ROM to an SD card and listen to it on actual hardware. Note that expansion audio is not supported with this mapper. The user interface is very simple, pressing left/right on the D-PAD will change the current track. Track/song names will be truncated to 28 characters. For something a lot more customizable, check out EZNSF by Brad Smith. FamiTracker Text You can export songs to FamiTracker using their Text Export format. There are some limitations: Pitch envelopes with looping sections will be modified on export so that the looping part sums to zero. This is done to prevent pitch from drifting up/down every time the envelope loops. The reason for this is that FamiTracker's pitch envelopes are relative while FamiStudio's are absolute. Instruments using both pitch and arpeggio envlopes at the same time will not sound correct in FamiTracker. This is due to the vastly different way both applications handles these. FamiTracker re-triggers the pitch envelope at each arpeggio notes (probably the more sensible way), while FamiStudio simply runs both at the same time. For slide notes, FamiStudio will do its very best to choose which FamiTracker effect to use. Note that importing/exporting slide notes with FamiTracker should be considered a lossy process. Here are the general rules: If the slide note and its target are within 16 semitones, Qxx/Rxx (note slide up/down) will be favored as it is the most similar effect to what we are doing. Otherwise, if the previous note has the same pitch as the slide note, 3xx (auto-portamento) will be used. Finally, if none of these conditions are satisfied, 1xx/2xx (slide up/down) will be used. This is not ideal since the pitch might not exactly match the target note. Slide notes of VRC7 will definately not export perfectly due to the different way in which both applications handle VRC7 pitches. VRC6 saw channel is not incluenced by duty cycle in FamiStudio. FamiStudio always allow the full volume range for the saw. Import/export process does not try account for this. This might lead to volume inconsistencies between FamiTracker and FamiStudio where the volume needs to be doubled or halved to sound correct. Vibrato effect might sound slightly different once exported to FamiTracker. The speed values in FamiStudio are slightly different than FamiTracker. Here is a table relating the speeds in FamiStudio and FamiTracker (this is applied automatically when importing/exporting): FamiTracker speed FamiTracker period FamiStudio speed FamiStudio period 1 64 1 64 2 32 2 32 3 21.3 3 21 4 16 4 16 5 12.8 5 13 6 10.7 6 11 7 9.1 7 9 8 8 8 8 9 7.1 9 7 10 6.4 10 6 11 5.8 10 6 12 5.3 11 5 13 4.9 11 5 14 4.6 11 5 15 4.3 12 4 FamiStudio Text FamiStudio text format is a textual representation of the of the binary FamiStudio format. It is designed to favor interopability with other softwares, tools and sound engines. Exporting or importing this mostly lossless. The only this not stored in this format are the custom colors assigned to instruments, patterns and songs (they will be randomized every time you re-import the file). Format Specification The format describe one object per line followed by some attributes and values. Attribute are always between double-quotes. All indentation is purely cosmetic. Object Attribute1=\"Value1\" Attribute2=\"Value2\" The general structure of a file has these objects nested like this: Project : The root of the file. DPCMSample : A DPCM sample DPCMMapping : Maps a piano key to a DPCMSample. Instrument : An instrument Envelope : One envelope of an instrument Song : A song PatternCustomSettings : Custom length or tempo settings of a pattern colume. Channel : A channel of the NES (or audio expansion) Pattern : A short part of the song that can be repeated. Note : A note inside a pattern. PatternInstance : An instance (copy) of a pattern at a specific time.

When exporting file in seperate files, you can specific a name format template for each song. The {project} and {song} macros are available. When exporting as a single file (non-seperate), you will be prompt to name the output assembly file. If any of the exported songs uses DPCM samples, a .dmc file of the same name will also be outputted. If you are using the FamiStudio tempo mode and wish to have correct PAL playback in you homebrew game, please check out this custom version of FamiTone2 (named FamiTone2FS) that supports it: https://github.com/BleuBleu/FamiTone2FS Importing Songs To import songs, simply open a file. On Windows it is also possible drag & drop a file in the application. FamiTracker Text or Binary Import from FamiTracker (official 0.4.6 only) is supported through the text (TXT file) or binary format (FTM file). Note that only a small subset of features is supported. Only the following effects are supported. Every other effect will be ignored: 1xx/2xx (Slide up/down) : Will be converted to slide notes 3xx (Portamento) : Will be converted to slide notes. 4xy (Vibrato) : Vibrator speed will be slightly modified, see table above for mapping. Bxx (Jump) : Will be converted to loop point. Dxx (Skip) : Will be converted to a custom pattern length. Fxx (Speed) : Only speed is supported. Pxx (Fine pitch) : Fully supported. Hxx (FDS Modulation depth) : Fully supported. Ixx/Jxx (FDS Modulation speed) : Fully supported, but combined in one 16-bit value. Besides effects, there are also other limitations: When the limit of 16KB is reached, all subsequent DPCM samples will stop loading. Namco 163 instrument can only have a single waveform. Any other waveform than zero will be ignored. Namco 163 instrument only support wave size 4, 8, 16 and 32 and wave positions that are multiples of these sizes. Other values might lead to undefined behaviors. VRC7 1xx/2xx/3xx/Qxx/Rxx effects will likely not sound like FamiTracker and will need manual corrections. Instruments using both pitch and arpeggio envlopes at the same time will not sound the same as in FamiTracker. This is due to the vastly different way both applications handles these. FamiTracker re-triggers the pitch envelope at each arpeggio notes (probably the more sensible way), while FamiStudio simply runs both at the same time.

FamiStudio Text The FamiStudio text format is support, please see the documentation above for the format specification. Nintendo Sound Format NSF (and NSFE) files can be imported in FamiStudio. This includes NSF with expansion audio. When opening and NSF file, you will be presented a dialog box. You will need to chose the song to import and specify a duration (in sec) to extract from the NSF. Most NSF file will not contain the names of songs so they will usually have placeholder names. NSF file are essentially programs designed to run on actual hardware. They will contain no instrument, no envelopes, no repeating pattern, etc. All the volumes and pitches will be set through the effect panel. They are going to appear extremely messy and unoptimized. That being said, NSF can still be extremely useful to reverse engineer how songs were made. In fact, this is how most of the Demo Songs that come with FamiStudio were made. In the example below, we can imagine that the notes on the right were all using the same instrument with a decreasing volume envelope. The notes of the left were clearly using a vibrato effect or a pitch envelope. Only features that are supported by FamiStudio will be imported. Things like hardware sweeps & advanced DPCM manipulations will all be ignored.","title":"Importing & Exporting Your Songs"},{"location":"importexport/#exporting-songs","text":"The export dialog is access through the main toolbar.","title":"Exporting Songs"},{"location":"importexport/#wave-file","text":"Only a single song can be exported at a time.

You will need to chose the song to import and specify a duration (in sec) to extract from the NSF. Most NSF file will not contain the names of songs so they will usually have placeholder names. NSF file are essentially programs designed to run on actual hardware. They will contain no instrument, no envelopes, no repeating pattern, etc. All the volumes and pitches will be set through the effect panel. They are going to appear extremely messy and unoptimized. That being said, NSF can still be extremely useful to reverse engineer how songs were made. In fact, this is how most of the Demo Songs that come with FamiStudio were made. In the example below, we can imagine that the notes on the right were all using the same instrument with a decreasing volume envelope. The notes of the left were clearly using a vibrato effect or a pitch envelope. Only features that are supported by FamiStudio will be imported.

This section is only going to cover editing of instruments. Please refer to the Editing Songs & Project section to learn how to edit project and song properties. Most instrument (except DPCM samples) has 4 buttons : The duty cycle envelope The volume envelope The pitch envelope The arpeggio envelope An envelope is simply a parameter that can change over the duration of a note as it plays. It can be used to create vibrato, tremolo, change the attack and release of a note, for example. If an instrument currently has no envelope for a particular type, it will appear dimmed. For details on Expansion audio instruments please visit the Expansion Audio section . Editing instrument properties Double-clicking on an instrument will show its properties. Relative pitch : By default, FamiStudio's pitch envelope are absolute. Meaning that the envelope values are the pitch you are going to hear, this is especially useful for vibrato where you can draw a simple sine wave. It is sometimes useful to have relative pitch envelope to create pitches that rapidly ascend or decend (useful for bassdrum sounds). This is how FamiTracker handles pitch envelopes. Adding instruments You can an instrument by pressing the \"+\" sign, and you can one by right-clicking on it. Deleting an instrument will delete all notes used by that instrument. Replacing an instrument by another Clicking on an instrument name and dragging it over another instrument will allow you to replace all notes of the first instrument by the second. This is useful prior to deleting an instrument. Importing FamiTracker instruments You can import FamiTracker instrument files (FTI files, official FamiTracker 0.4.6 only) by clicking the little folder icon. Editing instrument envelopes Clicking on an envelope icon in the project explorer will open the envelope of that instrument in the piano roll. The length of the envelope can be changed by left-clicking (and potentially dragging) in the timeline of the piano roll. Setting the length of an envelope to zero will disable it. The loop point of an envelope can be set by right-clicking in the timeline. Volume tracks are also allowed to have release envelopes. Release envelopes are played when a release note is encountered and terminates the loop by jumping to the release point. This is useful for fading out notes smoothly. The release point is set by right-dragging from the rightmost side of the envelope. Copying envelopes Clicking on an envelope button and dragging it on another instrument will copy that envelope from the first to the second. Note that unlike FamiTracker, envelopes are not explicitly shared between instruments. Identical envelopes will be combined when exporting to FamiTone2, but it is your responsibility to optimize the content and ensure that you limit the number of unique envelopes. Deleting envelopes Right-clicking on the icon of an envelope deletes it. Editing DPCM samples Clicking on the little icon next to the DPCM samples in the project explorer will open the piano roll in DPCM edition mode. Clicking anywhere on a note that does not have a DPCM sample associated will prompt you to open a .DMC file. No DMC edition tool is provided, you can use FamiTracker , RJDMC or any other tool. DPCM samples are assumed to have unique names and 2 samples with the same name will be assume to be the same. Double-clicking on an existing sample edits its pitch and toggle loop.

Subdivision Horizontal lines in the piano rolls are align with the notes of the piano. The vertical lines represents multiple levels of subdivisions: Thick black lines seperate patterns (not shown in this image) Thin black lines seperate bars (a bar is a simple group of notes, purely a visual aid) Thin gray lines seperate notes Thin dashes gray lines seperate individual NTSC frames, 1/60th of a sec. (FamiStudio tempo mode only) In FamiTracker tempo mode, you do not have access to the individual frames, so the dashes lines will not be visible. Seeking Clicking in the timeline (header) of the piano roll will move the play position. Adding and deleting notes Clicking a pattern in the sequencer will scroll the piano roll to its location. Left-clicking in the piano roll will add a note of the currently selected instrument. Holding the mouse when clicking will allow you to drag the note and will give audio feedback. You cannot add a note where the is not a pattern created. Right-clicking deletes a note. Stop & Release notes Using Ctrl+click will add a stop note. Stops notes are displayed as little triangles. Although they are displayed next to the note preceding them, they actually have no pitch or instrument, they simply stop the sound. Stop notes are important because on the NES, a note will play indefinitely unless you tell it to stop. Using Shift+click will add a release notes. Release notes are shown as making the note thinner and triggers the envelope to jump to the release point. Release envelopes are useful to nicely fade out a note when its release, while preserving other effects like vibrato. There is no point to adding a release note to an instrument that does not have a release envelope. Hovering the mouse in the piano roll will display the location and note in the toolbar. Hovering over a note will display which instrument it uses. Note attack By default, notes will have an \"attack\" which mean they will restart their envelopes (volume, pitch, etc.) from the beginning. This is represented by the little dark rectangle on the left of each note. This can be toggled for a particular note by hold the A key and clicking on a note. Note that if a note does not use the same instrument as the previous one, the attack will still play, even if disabled. Also please note that this will generally not carry over to FamiTracker, besides specific use cases around slide notes. In this example, the first note will have an attack, while the second one will not. Since envelopes are not resetted, this means that if a note was released, it will remain released if the subsequent notes have no attack. Slide notes Slide notes are notes that start at a given pitch (the pitch of the note) and slowly change to hit a target pitch which is represented by where the triangle ends. In this example, the attack of the second note has been disabled. Slide notes garantees that the target pitch will be reached by the end of the note (end of the triangle) but this might happen a bit earlier than the visual repesentation suggests. Especially in the higher pitches. This is due to the fact that the pitch calculations are all integer-based (with 1-bit of fraction) and it is often impossible to get the exact required slope to reach the pitch at the exact time. Selecting and editing notes You can select notes by right-clicking and dragging in the header of the piano roll. Selected notes will appear with a thick silver border. Once notes are selected, then can be moved using the arrows keys (up, down, left and right). Holding CTRL while doing so will make the notes move by larger increments. Cutting, copying and pasting notes Much like the sequencer, selcted notes can be copy (or cut) by pressing CTRL+C (or CTRL+X). You can then move the selection somewhere else and paste the notes with CTRL+V. Special paste If you want to paste notes, without their associated effets or volume track (or vice-versa). You can use a \"special paste\" by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+V. This will open a popup dialog asking you to choose what you want to paste. Editing volume tracks & effects The effect panel can be opened by clicking the little triangle at the top-left of the piano roll. Right now, only a handful of effects are supported: Volume : The overall volume of the channel. Vib Speed : Vibrato speed, used in conjuction with vibrato depth to create a vibrato effect. Vib Depth : Vibrato depth, used in conjuction with vibrato speed to create a vibrato effect. Pitch : Allow tweaking the fine-pitch of a channel. FDS Speed : Famicom Disk System audio modulation speed (FDS audio expansion only). FDS Depth : Famicom Disk System audio modulation depth (FDS audio expansion only). Speed : Changes the speed of the song (FamiTracker tempo mode only) Effects are edited by selecting and effect and dragging up or down to change the value. Right-clicking on an effect value deletes it. For effects that have huge values (such as FDS Depth), you can hold Shift to fine tune the exact value (a movement of 1 pixel will change the value by 1). Volume track The volume tracks dictates how loud the current channel should play. This volume is combined with volume envelope by multiplication (50% volume track x 50% envelope volume = 25% total volume). It is much more efficient to use volume envelopes wherever possible and only use volume tracks to control the global volume of the song. Vibrato depth & speed. Vibrato depth and speed are used to add vibrato to a portion of the song without having to bother creating a new instrument. Please note that vibrato will temporarely override any pitch envelope on the current instrument. When vibrato is disabled (by setting depth or speed, or both to zero), the instrument will essentially have no pitch envelope until a new note is played. The depth values for the vibrato are indentical to FamiTracker but the speeds are slightly different. The way FamiTracker implements vibrato, while clever, is flawed as it undersamples the vibrato curve at high speed, leading to aliasing which ends up with a low-frequency tone that has a \"ringing\" sound to it. Please see the Import/Export for a table that maps between FamiStudio and FamiTracker. Pitch Controls the global pitch of the track.

Expansion will add extra channels on top of the default 5 that the NES supported. Note that changing the expansion audio in a project will delete all data (patterns, notes, instrument) related to the previous expansion. Please visit the Expansion Audio section for more detail about each expansion. Tempo Modes The tempo mode will affect how the tempo of you songs is calculated, how much control you have over the notes of your song and how your song plays on PAL systems. Note that changing the tempo mode when you have songs created is possible, but not recommended, the conversion is quite crude at the moment. FamiStudio tempo mode (default) In this mode, you always have control over every single frame (1/60th of a second of the song) and you always edit in NTSC. You will be able to choose a Note Length which has a fixed number a frame (1/60s). More frames means a slower tempo. The biggest different with FamiTracker tempo is in the way it handles PAL conversion. For example, in the image below, we have a 7 NTSC frames (1/60th of a sec) per note. On PAL system, it takes only 6 frames (1/50th of a sec) to cover approximately the same amount of time. Since our song is edited and stored as NTSC and we want to faitfully play it back on PAL systems, FamiStudio will sometimes run 2 NTSC frames in a single PAL frame so it can keep up with NTSC. To make the PAL playback speed even more similar, the frame skips are ditributed over multiple notes, leading to a PAL playback speed error that is always less that 0.15%. This table sumarizes the number of frames that will be skipped on PAL for different note length, as well as their exact positions inside the notes. Number of NTSC frames (1/60 sec) Number of frames skipped by PAL Position of skipped frames BPM 1 1 frame every 6 notes 0 900.0 2 1 frame every 3 notes 1 450.0 3 1 frame every 2 notes 1 300.0 4 2 frames every 3 notes 2 225.0 5 5 frames every 6 note 2 180.0 6 1 frames every 1 note 2 150.0 7 7 frames every 6 note 2, 4 128.6 8 4 frames every 3 note 2, 5 112.5 9 3 frames every note 2, 6 100.0 10 5 frames every 3 note 2, 7 90.0 11 11 frames every 6 note 2, 8 81.8 12 2 frames every 1 note 3, 8 75.0 13 11 frames every 5 note 2, 6, 10 69.2 14 7 frames every 3 note 2, 6, 11 64.3 15 5 frames every 2 note 2, 7, 12 60.0 16 8 frames every 3 note 3, 8, 12 56.3 17 20 frames every 7 note 3, 8, 13 52.9 18 3 frames every 1 note 3, 8, 14 50.0 Note that you arent not limited to the BPM values suggested by the different note lengths. You can create in-between ones by putting multiples notes into a larger one. For example, Gimmick! uses a 11 frames per note, but puts 2 notes inside it. One of 5 frames and one of 6 frames. This creates an approximate tempo of 163.6 BPM and the different note lengths is not audible. The FamiTracker documentation has a handy chart for these. Note that you are limited to 18 frames per note a the moment. If you are using the FamiStudio tempo mode and wish to have correct PAL playback in you homebrew game, please check out this custom version of FamiTone2 (named FamiTone2FS) that supports it: https://github.com/BleuBleu/FamiTone2FS FamiTracker tempo mode This mode is mostly for compatibility with FamiTracker. It uses the speed/tempo paradigm. Please check out the FamiTracker documentation for a detailed explanation on how the playback speed is affected. If you import a FamiTracker Text or FTM file, it will be in this tempo mode. Only use this mode if you have specific compatibility needs with FamiTracker (such as exporting to an audio engine that only supports this tempo mode), as it will not receive any future improvement. When using this tempo mode, the Speed effect will be available in the effect panel. Delayed notes and delayed cuts are not supported and will likely never be as they are inherentely a tracker-centric feature. Editing song properties Double-clicking on the a song will allow you to change its name, color and other attributes. Names must be unique. This dialog will look very different depending on the Tempo Mode of the current project. FamiStudio Tempo FamiTracker tempo Common properties: Song length : The number of patterns in the song Notes Per Pattern : Default number of notes in a pattern. Pattern length can be customized on a per-pattern basis in the Sequencer. Notes Per Bar : Number of notes in a bar. The piano roll will draw a darker line at every bar. Simply a visual aid, does not affect the audio in any way Properties unique FamiTracker tempo mode: Speed : How much the timer is increment each frame, values other than 150 might create uneven notes Tempo : How many frames to wait before advancing to the next note (at least when using the integral tempo or 150) Properties unique FamiStudio tempo mode: Frames Per Notes : How many frames (1/60th) in a typical notes. Values between 5 and 16 are recommended as they create the least error on PAL system. These parameters will affect the look of the piano roll.","title":"Editing Songs & Project"},{"location":"song/#editing-project-properties","text":"The project explorer displays the name of the project, the list of songs and instruments in the current project.

Note that changing the tempo mode when you have songs created is possible, but not recommended, the conversion is quite crude at the moment.","title":"Tempo Modes"},{"location":"song/#famistudio-tempo-mode-default","text":"In this mode, you always have control over every single frame (1/60th of a second of the song) and you always edit in NTSC. You will be able to choose a Note Length which has a fixed number a frame (1/60s). More frames means a slower tempo. The biggest different with FamiTracker tempo is in the way it handles PAL conversion. For example, in the image below, we have a 7 NTSC frames (1/60th of a sec) per note. On PAL system, it takes only 6 frames (1/50th of a sec) to cover approximately the same amount of time. Since our song is edited and stored as NTSC and we want to faitfully play it back on PAL systems, FamiStudio will sometimes run 2 NTSC frames in a single PAL frame so it can keep up with NTSC. To make the PAL playback speed even more similar, the frame skips are ditributed over multiple notes, leading to a PAL playback speed error that is always less that 0.15%. This table sumarizes the number of frames that will be skipped on PAL for different note length, as well as their exact positions inside the notes. Number of NTSC frames (1/60 sec) Number of frames skipped by PAL Position of skipped frames BPM 1 1 frame every 6 notes 0 900.0 2 1 frame every 3 notes 1 450.0 3 1 frame every 2 notes 1 300.0 4 2 frames every 3 notes 2 225.0 5 5 frames every 6 note 2 180.0 6 1 frames every 1 note 2 150.0 7 7 frames every 6 note 2, 4 128.6 8 4 frames every 3 note 2, 5 112.5 9 3 frames every note 2, 6 100.0 10 5 frames every 3 note 2, 7 90.0 11 11 frames every 6 note 2, 8 81.8 12 2 frames every 1 note 3, 8 75.0 13 11 frames every 5 note 2, 6, 10 69.2 14 7 frames every 3 note 2, 6, 11 64.3 15 5 frames every 2 note 2, 7, 12 60.0 16 8 frames every 3 note 3, 8, 12 56.3 17 20 frames every 7 note 3, 8, 13 52.9 18 3 frames every 1 note 3, 8, 14 50.0 Note that you arent not limited to the BPM values suggested by the different note lengths. You can create in-between ones by putting multiples notes into a larger one. For example, Gimmick! uses a 11 frames per note, but puts 2 notes inside it. One of 5 frames and one of 6 frames. This creates an approximate tempo of 163.6 BPM and the different note lengths is not audible. The FamiTracker documentation has a handy chart for these. Note that you are limited to 18 frames per note a the moment.
