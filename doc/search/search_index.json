It will walk you through the creation a simple song, from beginning to end. Installation Depending on how you download FamiStudio, you might get scary warnings the first time you try to install or run it. Windows On Windows, if you get an error trying to start the application, but sure to install these 2 requirements: You will need the Visual Studio 2015 runtime (x86 version) You also may need (especially on Windows 7) to install this rather old and cluncky DirectX package It is going to ask you to extra the files to somewhere, extract to a temporary folder Run DXSETUP.exe inside that temporary folder to really install. Delete the temp folder afterwards to cleanup. On Windows, SmartScreen might say \"Windows protected your PC\". To bypass the warning, simply click \"More Info\" and then \"Run Anyway\". MacOS On MacOS, you will need to install Mono . GateKeeper can be quite agressive when first running the application. At first it will look like you simply cannot run it and it will give you the option to throw FamiStudio in the recycling bin. To bypass this warning, open the \"Security and Privacy\" settings and look for the warning saying that FamiStudio was blocked. Click \"Open Anyway\" and then you will have the option to launch it. Linux The Linux version should work on most x64 ditros. But given the very non-stardard nature of the OS, your mileage may vary. Please install the following dependencies before trying ot run the Linux version. Install Mono Install gtk-sharp2, this is usually by typing this, but this might vary depending on your distro : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 Then to run provided amd64 (basically any x64 processor), simply run: mono FamiStudio.exe If you run a very old version of Linux or if you are running an exotic architecture, you may have missing dependencies. If this is the case, you may have to compile some of the libraries. This is a rather manual process. Please follow the build steps on GitHub .","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"Welcome to the FamiStudio documentation.

Patterns contain Notes which are played by an Instrument (DPCM samples do not require an instrument) and may refer to an arpeggio. Instruments may have some of their attributes (pitch, volume, arpeggio) modulated by Envelopes. Most of the operations are performed with the mouse. In general: The left mouse button adds stuff, double-clicking something edits properties (songs, patterns, instruments, DPCM) The right mouse button removes stuff. Right clicking in the header of the Sequencer or Piano Roll selects. The middle mouse button pans when you press it and zooms and you use the mouse wheel. Alternatively, if your mouse does not have a middle mouse button or mouse wheel: All actions requiring pressing the middle mouse buttons can be done with Alt+Left click. All actions requiring the mouse wheel can be performed with Alt+Right click, then dragging up/down. If you are working on a trackpad, please check out how to enable Trackpad controls in the configuration dialog. Main Window The UI was designed to be a simple as possible, there are almost no context menus. The main window has 4 main components: The Toolbar (on top) The Project Explorer (on the right) is where you add/remove/edit songs and instruments. The Sequencer (below the toolbar) is where you schedule your patterns on one of the 5 channels. It gives a high-level view of the song. The Piano Roll (below the sequencer) is where you edit your patterns. At any given moment there is always: A selected channel, in bold in the sequencer A selected song, in bold in the project explorer song list A selected instrument, in bold in the project explorer instrument list. A selected arpeggio, in bold in the project explorer arpeggio list. The sequencer and piano roll will display the information for the currently selected song. When pressing the keys on the piano roll, it will play notes for the currently selected instrument, and output it on the currently selected channel. The same applies if you have a MIDI keyboard connected. Toolbar The main toolbar contains your usual stuff: file operation, undo/redo, timecode and play control. Tooltip Keyboard shortcuts or special actions are always displayed as tooltips in the upper-right corner of the toolbar. Please keep an eye on it to learn new functionalities. Playing/pausing the song Besides the toolbar, space bar is used to play/pause the song. Ctrl-space plays in pattern loop mode, Shift-space plays in song loop mode. Changing the looping mode There are 3 looping modes: Song : loops the entire song Pattern : loops at the end of the current pattern None : stops at the end of the song Saving the project Clicking on the icon save the project, right-clicking is a \"save as...\" and will prompt you for a new filename. Exporting to various formats Please see the Import/Export section for details on how to export to various formats. Cleanup dialog Please see the Cleanup section for details on how to cleanup your project. Configuration dialog Please see the Configuration section for details on how to configure FamiStudio. Project Explorer The project explorer displays the list of songs and instruments in the current project. For more details on what you can do with the Project Explorer, please check out these sections: Editing Songs & Project Editing Instruments & Arpeggios Sequencer The sequencer is where you organize the high-level structure of the song: which patterns play and when they play. The thumbnails of the patterns in the sequencer are by no mean accurate. Please visit the Editing Patterns section for more details. Piano Roll The piano roll is where you editing the actual notes of the song, the instrument envelopes, as well as some special effects. Please check out the Editing Notes section for more details. Keyboard shortcuts Here is a list of useful keyboard shortcuts: Space : Play/stop the stop Enter : Toggles recording mode. Ctrl+Space : Plays from beginning of current pattern. Shift+Space : Plays from beginning of the song. Home : Seeks back to beginning of the song. Ctrl+Home : Seeks to beginning of the current pattern. Esc : Stops any lindering sound, stops recording mode, clears the selection. Ctrl+Z : Undo Ctrl+Y : Redo Ctrl+N : New project Ctrl+S : Save Ctrl+E : Export Ctrl+Shift+E : Repeat last export Ctrl+O : Open Delete : Delete selected patterns or notes. Escape : Deselects patterns or notes, stops any sound that is stuck playing. 1...5 : Changes the active channel (more than 5 if you have expansion audio enabled). Ctrl+1...5 : Force display a channel. (more than 5 if you have expansion audio enabled). Some keyboard shortcuts specific to the sequencer: L+Click : Sets the loop point at the clicked pattern. Some keyboard shortcuts specific to the piano roll: Ctrl+Click : Adds a stop note. Shift+Click : Adds a release note. S+Click (and drag): Creates or edit a slide note. A+Click : Toggles the attack of a note. I+Click : Instrument picker ~ (Tilde) : Expand/collapse the effect panel. Shift+S : Toggles snapping. When QWERTY keyboard input is active, some of the keys will be overriden to support piano input.","title":"Basics"},{"location":"basics/#concepts","text":"A FamiStudio project contains: A list of Songs A list of Instruments A list of DPCM samples A list of Arpeggios Songs are made of Patterns, which are on one of the five Channels supported by the NES.

It can perform various cleaning operations, such as deleting unused elements and merging identical ones. Cleaning-up Song Here are the operations that can be performed on songs: Merge identical patterns : Patterns that are identical on the same channel will be assumed to be the same and will all be replaced by instances of a single one. To be identical, patterns must have the exact same notes, effects, etc. Delete empty patterns : Patterns with zero notes or effect values will be deleted. Only applies to the selected songs. Cleaning-up Projects Here are the operations that can be performed on the project: Merge identical instruments : Instruments that have the same settings and envelopes will be combined into ones and every notes using the intruments to be deleted will use the new one. Delete unused instruments : Instruments without a single note played will be deleted. Unassign unused DPCM instrument keys : Unassign samples to keys of the DPCM instrument that are not used by any song in the project.

They are of very low quality but have been used quite successfully for drums and basses. To use a DPCM sample, it first needs to be loaded, then it needs to be assigned to a key of the piano, in the DPCM instrument. The samples workflow in FamiStudio is lossless in a way that once a sample is imported, any modification done to it will not modify the source data. Every time a parameter is changed, the source data will be re-processed to generate the final sample. If you do not wish to use the built-in DPCM sample editor of FamiStudio there are many other alternative : FamiTracker , RJDMC and MakeDPCM . Loading DPCM Samples Samples are loaded by clicking the little folder icon next to the \"DPCM Samples\" section in the project explorer. FamiStudio can import samples from a WAV file or from a DMC file. Not that importing DMC files and doing extensive processing is not recommended as these samples are very low-quality fo begin with and any extra processing will degrade it further. Once loaded, you can rename a sample or change its color by double-clicking on this button. You can also play the sample by clicking the little play button next to it: Left-clicking will play the processed sample. Right-clicking will play the source sample (DMC or WAV). Modifying DPCM Samples Once a sample is loaded, it can be expanded by clicking the little arrow to reveal some of its properties. Preview Rate : Rate at which to preview the sample when pressing the little Play button. It has no impact on the processing of the sample. These sample rates are the sample rates supported by the NES/Famicom and are the same as when you assign a sample to a key of the piano. These will change slighting depending if you are playing back in NTSC or PAL mode. Sample Rate : Rate at which to re-sample the sample. This can be useful to lower the size of the final sample, but will also degrade the quality significantly. To keep the pitch consistent, you probably should adjust the preview rate to match the sample rate. Padding Mode : Affects how the final size of the sample is calculated: Unpadded : The sample will be unpadded. Pad to 16 : The sample will be padded with silence until a multiple of 16 bytes is reached. This is what most games did and will cause an extra by of garbage to be played every time the sample is played, but this is usucally not audible. Pad to 16 + 1 : The sample will be padded with silence until a multiple of 16 bytes (plus one) is reached. This is technically the best way to process samples and it will ensure that no extra garbage sample is played but will waste 15 bytes. Round to 16 : The sample will be resampled in a way that the end of sample aligned to 16 bytes. This may affect the pitch slightly. This will cause an extra by of garbage to be played every time the sample is played, but this is usucally not audible. Round to 16 + 1 : The sample will be resampled in a way that the end of sample aligned to 16 bytes (plus one). This may affect the pitch slightly. This is a good mode to create looping samples. Volume Adjust : Global volume adjustment, from 0% to 200%. Process as PAL : Perform all resampling/processing using PAL sample rates. Trim Zero Volume : Remove leading/trailing parts of the waveform that have near-zero volume. Reverse Bits : This option is only enabled when the source data is a DMC file. Will reverse the bits of each byte. This can be used correct problem is some existing games where samples were packed backwards. Editing DPCM Waveform Waveform overview Clicking on the waveform icon next to a sample will reveal its waveform in the piano roll. The source sample is display in gray The processed sample is display in the color of the sample The color of in the header will also show the length of the processed sample, which may be shorter than the source. Selecting and deleting samples Zooming in will reveal the indivual samples of both waveforms. It is possible to select samples of the source data to trim them (by pressing the Delete key). Note that deleting samples manually is the only destructive operation that you can perform on the source data. Adjusting volume with the volume envelope Much like when editing notes, the effect panel can be expanded by clicking the little arrow in the upper left corner of the piano roll. This will reveal the 4-point volume envelope which can be used to adjust the volume of sample with more precision. The center line represents 100% volume which the bottom and top represente 0% and 200% respectively. You can drag the envelope points by left clicking and dragging them. Note that the first and last vertex will always be at the beginning and end of the sample. Right-clicking on a vertex will reset its volume to 100%. This is especially powerful when combined with the \"Trim Zero Volume\" option. For example, in the example above, the sample is made a lot shorter (and smaller) without deleting anything from the source data by reducing the volume to zero and letting FamiStudio trim the part with zero volume. Exporting DPCM samples Clicking on the little disk icon in the Project Explorer allows you to export a sample. Both the source and processed data can be exported. Left-clicking will export the processed sample as a DMC file. Right-clicking will export the source data (in its original format, WAV or DMC) Assigning a DPCM sample to a key of the DPCM instrument Once a sample is loaded, it can be assign to a key of the \"DPCM instrument\". Clicking on the little icon next to the DPCM Instrument in the project explorer will open the piano roll in DPCM edition mode. Samples can be assign to a key in 2 ways: Click in the piano roll will prompt you to select sample Dragging a sample from the Project Explorer will allow you to place it anywhere on the keyboard Unassigning a DPCM sample Right clicking on a sample that has been mapped to a key will remove it from that key. The memory for a sample will not be freed if it is still being used by another key. Moving DPCM samples to another key DPCM samples can be dragged to another key. When the drag is completed, FamiStudio will offer you to transpose all notes using the old key to the new key. Editing DPCM samples properties Double-clicking on an existing sample will show its properties. These are the property of the assignment of the sample to this key, not of the sample itself (the same sample can be used at different pitch, for example). Pitch : Allows pitching the sample down. These pitch values are the sample rates that the NES/Famicom supports and will sound a bit different on NTSC or PAL.

These chips added a few extra audio channels on top of the standard 5 channels. List of expansions supported: Konami VRC6 : Adds 2 square channels and a Sawtooth channel. The square channels are better quality than the stock square as they give more control over the duty cycle and don't suffer for the phase reset bug. Konami VRC7 : Adds 6 FM synthesis channels. It was based off the Yamaha YM2413 OPLL. Qualitatively, it sounds like an old SoundBlaster card from the 90s. It has 15 preset patches and a user-defined one. Since only 1 user-defined patch can be defined, one has to be careful not to use multiple custom patches at the same time from different channels. Famicom Disk System : Adds an extra channel that uses a wavetable and a modulation unit to create a wide range of sound. Nintendo MMC5 : Adds 2 extra square channels. They are extremely similar to the regular square channels of the Famicom, and also suffer from the same phase reset issue. Unlike the stock square channels, the reset bug cannot be worked around. Namco 163 : Adds up to 8 wavetable channels. It has 128 bytes of RAM to store all the currently used waveforms. Waveforms can be 4, 8, 16 and 32 in size. Smaller waveforms will sound worse, but you can have more of them at any given time. FamiStudio will work at its best with a sample size of 16. Also, it should be noted that for technical reasons, the more channels you add, the worse the audio quality will be. It is recommanded that you use 4 channels or less, which is what most games using the expansion did. Sunsoft S5B : Add 3 extra square channels. These channels are fixed at a duty cycle or 50%. It was based off the Yamaha YM2149F. While this expansion was extremely powerful, it was only ever used in one game (Gimmick!) and this game did not make use of any advanced features of the chip. For this reason, FamiStudio (and most emulator) only support a small subset of features. Enabling expansion audio The expansion audio used is set in the project properties, which you can access by double-clicking on the project name (first row in the Project Explorer). Enabling any kind of expansion audio will automatically disable PAL support. Expansion instruments Almost all expansion audio requires using special instruments on the expansion channels, the only exception being MMC5 because of its similarity with the regular square channels. When you have an expansion enabled and try to create an instrument, you will be asked what time of instrument you want to create. Certain expansion instrument have parameters that are very different from standard instrument. Some of these parameters are accessed by expanding the instrument by clicking on the little triangle on the left of its name. VRC7 VRC7 instruments are by far the ones with the most parameters. Roughly speaking, the chip generates a carier frequency, which is then modified by a modulator. To configure this properly, you should be familiar with the Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release (ADSR) way of generating sound. Patch : Allows you to select one of the built-in patch. Changing any parameter value will revert back to the \"Custom\" patch as it is the only one that can be configured. Carier / Modulator : Tremolo : Toggle use of tremolo. The rate of the tremolo is fixed and cannot be changed. Vibrato : Toggle use of vibrato. The rate of the vibrato is fixed and cannot be changed. Sustained : Toggle use of sustain in the envelope. Wave Rectified : If enabled, clips the waveform to zero. Key Scaling : Toggle use of the KeyScaling Level parameter. KeyScaling Level : Affects the speed of the ADSR envelope speed. FreqMultiplier : Multiplier on the frequency. Attack : Speed of the attack. Decay : Speed of the decay. Sustain : Attenuation after decay. Release : Speed of release. Modulator Level : Output level of the modulator. Feedback : Feedback applied to the modulator. Famicom Disk System The FDS instruments have 2 extra envelopes and a few extra parameter. The extra envelopes are: Waveform : The waveform of the instrument. It has a fixed length of 64 and can be fully customized. You can also choose from one of the presets. Modulation Table : The modulation table is used to modulate the waveform. It has a fixed length of 32 and can be fully customized. You can also choose from one of the presets. It has no effect if the modulation speed or depth is zero. Note that the way the modulation table is edited is very different from FamiTracker. All the internal complexity is hidden. The parameters are: Master Volume : At full volume the FDS can be significantly louder than the regular channels. The chip also supported 40%, 50% and 66% which makes the sound a lot more balanced. Wave Preset : A few preset that you can use to set the waveform envelope. Mod Preset : A few preset that you can use to set the modulation envelope. Mod Speed : The speed of the modulation. Mod Depth : The depth of the modulation. Mod Delay : A delay, in frames (1/60th of a second) before enabling modulation. When changing the values of the sliders with huge values (such as the Mod Speed), you can hold Shift while dragging to fine tune the exact value. Namco 163 The N163 instruments have an extra envelope and a few extra parameter. Note that FamiStudio's current implementation of N163 only supports a single waveform per instrument, unlike FamiTracker which has many. Extra envelope: Waveform : The waveform of the instrument. It will of a fixed length, as speficied by the \"Wave Size\" parameter. The parameters are: Wave Preset : A few preset that you can use to set the waveform envelope. Wave Size : The N163 chip had only 128 of RAM to store all the waveforms used at any given time. For example, if you use waveforms of size 32, you can only use 4 unique instrument at any given time. Using more will result in channels using wrong instruments. Wave Position : The position, in the 128 bytes of memory, of the waveform. You must manually make sure that different waveforms dont overlap.","title":"Using Expansion Audio"},{"location":"expansion/#using-expansion-audio","text":"","title":"Using Expansion Audio"},{"location":"expansion/#overview","text":"Expansion audio refers to extra hardware that were present on some Famicom cartridges (or add-on in the case of the Famicom Disk System).

To quickly repeat a previous export (same format and output file), you can right click on the export icon in the toolbar or press CTRL+SHIFT+E. Wave / MP3 File Only a single song can be exported at a time. You can choose the sample rate (and bitrate in case of MP3). It is recommended to stick to 44.1KHz if you want the sound to be exactly as you hear it in FamiStudio. Lower sample rate might lack high frequencies. The song can be exported in one of two modes: Play N Times: Will play the song a specified number of times. Duration : Will loop though the song for the specified number of seconds. You can also export each channel to individual by enabling \"Separate channel file\". Note that the quality of the MP3 encoding may not going to be as good as full fledge mp3 encoder such as LAME, but should be good enough for sending quick previews to people. Channels can optionally be muted. This can be used, for example, to create stereo mix using and external application. Video Video export is a great way to add a visual element to your songs when sharing them on YouTube/social media. For this to work, you will need to manually download FFmpeg and extract it somewhere on your computer. Besides the audio/video quality settings, there are a few options to control the look and feel of the video: Piano roll zoom : The higher the zoom, the faster notes will scroll by. Channels : It is recommended to not export channels that do not have any notes, this will leave more space to the other channels. Nintendo Sound Format Every feature supported by FamiStudio can be used in an NSF. Song that do not use any audio expansion can export as PAL and Dual mode, where as only NTSC is available for expansion audio. The maximum song size is approximately 28KB minus the size of the DPCM samples used. Note that this size are not printed anywhere and are not related to the size of the *.fms file. Best to simply try and see if it works. ROM / FDS Disk Song(s) can be exported to a NES ROM file or a Famicom Disk System disk to play if back on an emulator or on actual hardware. For ROM export, the current iteration uses Mapper 31 which is supported by most emulators and the Everdrive N8 . You can then copy the ROM to an SD card and listen to it on actual hardware. Note that expansion audio is not supported with this mapper. The user interface is very simple, pressing left/right on the D-PAD will change the current track. Track/song names will be truncated to 28 characters. For something a lot more customizable, check out EZNSF by Brad Smith. For FDS export, the process is very similar and will output a FDS disk image instead of a ROM. It has been tested on actual hardware using the FDSStick . Songs are loaded on demand from the disk, so switching tracks will be a bit slower on FDS than on a ROM. FamiTracker Text You can export songs to FamiTracker using their Text Export format. There are some limitations: Pitch envelopes with looping sections will be modified on export so that the looping part sums to zero. This is done to prevent pitch from drifting up/down every time the envelope loops. The reason for this is that FamiTracker's pitch envelopes are relative while FamiStudio's are absolute. Instruments using both pitch and arpeggio envelopes at the same time will not sound correct in FamiTracker. This is due to the vastly different way both applications handles these. FamiTracker re-triggers the pitch envelope at each arpeggio notes (probably the more sensible way), while FamiStudio simply runs both at the same time. For slide notes, FamiStudio will do its very best to choose which FamiTracker effect to use. Note that importing/exporting slide notes with FamiTracker should be considered a lossy process. Here are the general rules: If the slide note and its target are within 16 semitones, Qxx/Rxx (note slide up/down) will be favored as it is the most similar effect to what we are doing. Otherwise, if the previous note has the same pitch as the slide note, 3xx (auto-portamento) will be used. Finally, if none of these conditions are satisfied, 1xx/2xx (slide up/down) will be used. This is not ideal since the pitch might not exactly match the target note. Slide notes of VRC7 will definitely not export perfectly due to the different way in which both applications handle VRC7 pitches. VRC6 saw channel is not influenced by duty cycle in FamiStudio. FamiStudio always allow the full volume range for the saw. Import/export process does not try account for this. This might lead to volume inconsistencies between FamiTracker and FamiStudio where the volume needs to be doubled or halved to sound correct. Vibrato effect might sound slightly different once exported to FamiTracker. The speed values in FamiStudio are slightly different than FamiTracker. Here is a table relating the speeds in FamiStudio and FamiTracker (this is applied automatically when importing/exporting): FamiTracker speed FamiTracker period FamiStudio speed FamiStudio period 1 64 1 64 2 32 2 32 3 21.3 3 21 4 16 4 16 5 12.8 5 13 6 10.7 6 11 7 9.1 7 9 8 8 8 8 9 7.1 9 7 10 6.4 10 6 11 5.8 10 6 12 5.3 11 5 13 4.9 11 5 14 4.6 11 5 15 4.3 12 4 FamiStudio Text FamiStudio text format is a textual representation of the of the binary FamiStudio format. It is designed to favor interopability with other softwares, tools and sound engines. Exporting or importing using this format mostly lossless. These are the features that will not be preserved: The custom colors assigned to songs, instruments, patterns, arpeggios and DPCM samples will not be preserved, they will be randomized every time you re-import the file. Only the final processed data of DPCM samples will exported. The source data as well as any processing parameter will be lost. Format Specification The format describe one object per line followed by some attributes and values. Attribute are always between double-quotes. All indentation is purely cosmetic. Object Attribute1=\"Value1\" Attribute2=\"Value2\" Double quotes in values can be escaped by doubling them, similar to some CSV dialects: Object Attribute1=\"Example \"\"Quoted\"\" Value1\" Attribute2=\"Value2\" The general structure of a file has these objects nested like this: Project : The root of the file. DPCMSample : A DPCM sample DPCMMapping : Maps a piano key to a DPCMSample.

FamiStudio / FamiTone2 Music Code Exporting music to the FamiStudio Sound Engine or FamiTone2 work very similarely. It will generate assembly code that can be included in your homebrew project and played using the FamiTone2 sound engine. When exporting file in separate files, you can specific a name format template for each song. The {project} and {song} macros are available. When exporting as a single file (non-separate), you will be prompt to name the output assembly file. If any of the exported songs uses DPCM samples, a .dmc file of the same name will also be outputted. FamiStudio / FamiTone2 Sound Effect Code The same goes for sound effect export. In this mode, one song is one sound effect, so songs should be very short. Unlike the FamiStudio/FamiTone2 music format which only support a subset of all the FamiTracker/FamiStudio features, here any feature (except DPCM samples) can be used and the sound effect should export correctly. Importing Songs To import songs, simply open a file. On Windows it is also possible drag & drop a file in the application. FamiTracker Text or Binary Import from FamiTracker (official 0.4.6 only) is supported through the text (TXT file) or binary format (FTM file). Note that only a small subset of features is supported. Only the following effects are supported. Every other effect will be ignored: 0xy (Arpeggio) : Will be converted to arpeggio, name will be based one the xy value. 1xx/2xx (Slide up/down) : Will be converted to slide notes 3xx (Portamento) : Will be converted to slide notes. 4xy (Vibrato) : Vibrator speed will be slightly modified, see table above for mapping. Bxx (Jump) : Will be converted to loop point. Cxx (Half) : Will truncate the song at the location of the effect and remove the loop point. Dxx (Skip) : Will be converted to a custom pattern length. Fxx (Speed) : Only speed is supported. Speed changed are not allowed to be delayed with Gxx. Gxx (Note delay) : Fully supported. Pxx (Fine pitch) : Fully supported. Hxx (FDS Modulation depth) : Fully supported. Ixx/Jxx (FDS Modulation speed) : Fully supported, but combined in one 16-bit value. Sxx (delayed cut) : Fully supported. Besides effects, there are also other limitations: If multiple instruments assign DPCM samples to the same key of the DPCM instrument, only the first one will be assigned. Other samples will be loaded, but unassigned to any keys. All DPCM samples will be loaded (and potentially assigned to a key of the DPCM instrument) but any sample over the 16KB FamiStudio limit will not play correctly or at all. Namco 163 instrument can only have a single waveform. Any other waveform than zero will be ignored. VRC7 1xx/2xx/3xx/Qxx/Rxx effects will likely not sound like FamiTracker and will need manual corrections. Instruments using both pitch and arpeggio envelopes at the same time will not sound the same as in FamiTracker. This is due to the vastly different way both applications handles these. FamiTracker re-triggers the pitch envelope at each arpeggio notes (probably the more sensible way), while FamiStudio simply runs both at the same time. VRC6 saw channel is not influenced by duty cycle in FamiStudio. FamiStudio always allow the full volume range for the saw. Import/export process does not try account for this. This might lead to volume inconsistencies between FamiTracker and FamiStudio where the volume needs to be doubled or halved to sound correct. Vibrato effect might sound a bit different, please see table above for exact mappings. The noise channel in FamiStudio is not affected by pitch envelope or any pitch effects (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, Qxx and Rxx). When importing from FamiTracker, all possible slide effects (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, Qxx and Rxx) will be converted to slide notes. Sometimes attack will be disabled as well to mimic the same behavior. This in an inherently imperfect process since they approaches are so different. For this reason, importing/exporting slide notes with FamiTracker should be considered a lossy process. FamiStudio Text The FamiStudio text format is support, please see the documentation above for the format specification. Nintendo Sound Format NSF (and NSFE) files can be imported in FamiStudio. This includes NSF with expansion audio. When opening and NSF file, you will be presented a dialog box. Most NSF file will not contain the names of songs so they will usually have placeholder names. Besides the song to import, are the most important settings : Duration : Time (in sec) to extract from the NSF. Pattern Length : Number of frames in a pattern. Start frame : Used to offset the entire song by a number of frames. This is useful when a song has an intro that is not the same length as the other patterns. Remove intro silence : Some songs start with a bit of silence, this will wait until any sound is produce to start recording. Reverse DPCM bits : This will set the \"Reverse Bits\" flag on all the imported samples. This come from a recent discovery that quite a few games had packed their bits in the wrong order, leading to samples sounding worse than they should. Preserve DPCM padding bytes : Force FamiStudio to keep the last byte of every sample, this will make all samples 16 bytes larger simply to keep an extra byte. This could be useful to keep looping samples intact. Should remain off most of the time since most games seem to ignore this byte. NSF file are essentially programs designed to run on actual hardware. They will contain no instrument, no envelopes, no repeating pattern, etc. All the volumes and pitches will be set through the effect panel. They are going to appear extremely messy and unoptimized. That being said, NSF can still be extremely useful to reverse engineer how songs were made. In fact, this is how most of the Demo Songs that come with FamiStudio were made. In the example below, we can imagine that the notes on the right were all using the same instrument with a decreasing volume envelope, and a 2-1 release. The note of the left were clearly using a vibrato effect or a pitch envelope. Only features that are supported by FamiStudio will be imported. Things like hardware sweeps & advanced DPCM manipulations will all be ignored. Error Log When importing/exporting from/to specific format, an error log may appear providing a list of warnings/errors that occured during the process. Please pay attention to these as they may explain why your song sound differently than intended.","title":"Importing & Exporting Your Songs"},{"location":"importexport/#exporting-songs","text":"The export dialog is access through the main toolbar or with CTRL+E on the keyboard.

Besides effects, there are also other limitations: If multiple instruments assign DPCM samples to the same key of the DPCM instrument, only the first one will be assigned. Other samples will be loaded, but unassigned to any keys. All DPCM samples will be loaded (and potentially assigned to a key of the DPCM instrument) but any sample over the 16KB FamiStudio limit will not play correctly or at all. Namco 163 instrument can only have a single waveform. Any other waveform than zero will be ignored. VRC7 1xx/2xx/3xx/Qxx/Rxx effects will likely not sound like FamiTracker and will need manual corrections. Instruments using both pitch and arpeggio envelopes at the same time will not sound the same as in FamiTracker. This is due to the vastly different way both applications handles these. FamiTracker re-triggers the pitch envelope at each arpeggio notes (probably the more sensible way), while FamiStudio simply runs both at the same time. VRC6 saw channel is not influenced by duty cycle in FamiStudio. FamiStudio always allow the full volume range for the saw. Import/export process does not try account for this. This might lead to volume inconsistencies between FamiTracker and FamiStudio where the volume needs to be doubled or halved to sound correct. Vibrato effect might sound a bit different, please see table above for exact mappings. The noise channel in FamiStudio is not affected by pitch envelope or any pitch effects (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, Qxx and Rxx). When importing from FamiTracker, all possible slide effects (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, Qxx and Rxx) will be converted to slide notes. Sometimes attack will be disabled as well to mimic the same behavior. This in an inherently imperfect process since they approaches are so different. For this reason, importing/exporting slide notes with FamiTracker should be considered a lossy process.","title":"FamiTracker Text or Binary"},{"location":"importexport/#famistudio-text_1","text":"The FamiStudio text format is support, please see the documentation above for the format specification.","title":"FamiStudio Text"},{"location":"importexport/#nintendo-sound-format_1","text":"NSF (and NSFE) files can be imported in FamiStudio. This includes NSF with expansion audio. When opening and NSF file, you will be presented a dialog box. Most NSF file will not contain the names of songs so they will usually have placeholder names. Besides the song to import, are the most important settings : Duration : Time (in sec) to extract from the NSF. Pattern Length : Number of frames in a pattern. Start frame : Used to offset the entire song by a number of frames. This is useful when a song has an intro that is not the same length as the other patterns. Remove intro silence : Some songs start with a bit of silence, this will wait until any sound is produce to start recording. Reverse DPCM bits : This will set the \"Reverse Bits\" flag on all the imported samples. This come from a recent discovery that quite a few games had packed their bits in the wrong order, leading to samples sounding worse than they should. Preserve DPCM padding bytes : Force FamiStudio to keep the last byte of every sample, this will make all samples 16 bytes larger simply to keep an extra byte. This could be useful to keep looping samples intact. Should remain off most of the time since most games seem to ignore this byte. NSF file are essentially programs designed to run on actual hardware. They will contain no instrument, no envelopes, no repeating pattern, etc. All the volumes and pitches will be set through the effect panel. They are going to appear extremely messy and unoptimized. That being said, NSF can still be extremely useful to reverse engineer how songs were made. In fact, this is how most of the Demo Songs that come with FamiStudio were made. In the example below, we can imagine that the notes on the right were all using the same instrument with a decreasing volume envelope, and a 2-1 release. The note of the left were clearly using a vibrato effect or a pitch envelope. Only features that are supported by FamiStudio will be imported.

This section is only going to cover editing of instruments and arpeggios. Please refer to the Editing Songs & Project section to learn how to edit project and song properties. Most instrument (except DPCM samples) has 4 buttons : The duty cycle envelope The volume envelope The pitch envelope The arpeggio envelope An envelope is simply a parameter that can change over the duration of a note as it plays. It can be used to create vibrato, tremolo, change the attack and release of a note, for example. If an instrument currently has no envelope for a particular type, it will appear dimmed. For details on Expansion audio instruments please visit the Expansion Audio section . Editing instrument properties Double-clicking on an instrument will show its properties. Relative pitch : By default, FamiStudio's pitch envelope are absolute. Meaning that the envelope values are the pitch you are going to hear, this is especially useful for vibrato where you can draw a simple sine wave. It is sometimes useful to have relative pitch envelope to create pitches that rapidly ascend or decend (useful for bassdrum sounds). This is how FamiTracker handles pitch envelopes. Adding instruments You can an instrument by pressing the \"+\" sign, and you can one by right-clicking on it. Deleting an instrument will delete all notes used by that instrument. Replacing an instrument by another Clicking on an instrument name and dragging it over another instrument will allow you to replace all notes of the first instrument by the second. This is useful prior to deleting an instrument. Importing instruments You can import intruments in your project from any supported input format, as well as FamiTracker instrument files (FTI files, official FamiTracker 0.4.6 only) by clicking the little folder icon. When importing instruments from another project or a FamiTracker file, you will be prompted with a list of instruments to import. Simply check the instrument to bring over. Note that instruments that are using incompatible expansion audio will not be able to be imported. Also, instruments with the same names are assumed to be the same. If you project already contains an instrument called \"Piano\" and you try to import another one called \"Piano\", nothing will happen. You are responsible to uniquely name your instruments if they are truly different. Editing instrument envelopes Clicking on an envelope icon in the project explorer will open the envelope of that instrument in the piano roll. The length of the envelope can be changed by left-clicking (and potentially dragging) in the timeline of the piano roll. Setting the length of an envelope to zero will disable it. The loop point of an envelope can be set by right-clicking in the timeline. Volume tracks are also allowed to have release envelopes. Release envelopes are played when a release note is encountered and terminates the loop by jumping to the release point. This is useful for fading out notes smoothly. The release point is set by right-dragging from the rightmost side of the envelope. Copying envelope values Right-clicking on the numbers on the header of the envelope editor allows for range selection of envelope values. These can then be copy and pasted elsewhere. It is also possible to paste envelope values coming for raw text. Any series of number that is space, tab, comma, semicolon or newline separated can be pasted in the envelope editor. Copying envelopes Clicking on an envelope button and dragging it on another instrument will copy that envelope from the first to the second. Note that unlike FamiTracker, envelopes are not explicitly shared between instruments. Identical envelopes will be combined when exporting to FamiTone2, but it is your responsibility to optimize the content and ensure that you limit the number of unique envelopes. Deleting envelopes Right-clicking on the icon of an envelope deletes it. DPCM Instrument The DPCM Instrument is a special instrument able to play DPCM samples. It is always present and cannot be deleted. For more information, please refer to the DPCM Samples section. Editing Arpeggios Arpeggios (not to be confused with arpeggio instrument envelopes) are typically used to simulate chords by playing changing notes very rapidly. They work in the exact same way as arpeggio instrument envelopes, but they are not bound to any specific instrument. For example, if you define a \"Major chord\" arpeggio that repeats a sequence 0-4-7 of notes, you can then re-use this arpeggio on any instrument later on. Saving you the trouble or either inputting many tiny notes, or creating many instruments for each chord. Arpeggios are handled in a very similar way to instrument. You can add a new arpeggio by click on the + button of the Arpeggios section. To edit the sequence of note you can then click of the little note icon on the right side of the arpeggio button. You can also assign a name and a color to each arpeggio by double-clicking on an arpeggio. This color will be displayed in the piano roll when the arpeggio is used. Replacing arpeggios by another Much like instrument, you can replace every usage of an arpeggio by another by simply dragging an arpeggio on to another. FamiStudio will prompt you to confirm the replacement. Copying arpeggios You can also copy the sequence of note from one arpeggio to another by dragging the little note icon (the one on the right side) on to another arpeggio.","title":"Editing Instruments & Arpeggios"},{"location":"instruments/#editing-instruments","text":"The project explorer displays the list of songs and instruments in the current project.

You can also use it to preview instrument by clicking on the keyboard. The currently selected instrument (in the project explorer) will play on the currently selected channel (in the sequencer). Subdivision Horizontal lines in the piano rolls are align with the notes of the piano. The vertical lines represents multiple levels of subdivisions: Thin dashes gray lines seperate individual NTSC frames, 1/60th of a sec. (FamiStudio tempo mode only) Thin gray lines seperate notes Thin black lines seperate beats Thick black lines seperate patterns In FamiTracker tempo mode, you do not have access to the individual frames, so the dashes lines will not be visible. Seeking Clicking in the timeline (header) of the piano roll will move the play position. You can also drag the seek back to more it more accurately. Adding and deleting notes Clicking a pattern in the sequencer will scroll the piano roll to its location. Left-clicking in the piano roll will add a note of the currently selected instrument. Holding the mouse when clicking will allow you to drag the note and will give audio feedback. You cannot add a note where the is not a pattern created. Right-clicking deletes a note. Instrument Picker Holding I and clicking on a note will make the instrument of that note the current instrument. This is often known as the eye dropper or pipette tool in drawing software. Recoding mode Recording mode is another way to input notes and is enabled by pressing the record button on the toolbar. Recording mode allows inputting notes using a MIDI controller or using a piano-type layout on the QWERTY keyboard. This layout is very similar to what FamiTracker uses. Note that this is not a \"real-time\" recording mode, simply a note-by-note input mode. The QWERTY keyboard input will give you a range of approximately 2.5 octaves. By default, this will go from C3 to C5 but it can be moved up/down by pressing Page Up and Page Down . Which keyboard key maps to which piano key will be displayed in the piano roll. When recording mode is active, the seek bar will turn red. Each note you input will be snapped to the current snap precision (see next section for info about snapping) and the seek bar will advance to the next snapping position. There are a few other special keys that are enabled when recording mode is activated: Backspace : moves back by 1 note (or snapping interval), erasing any note inside the interval. Tab : Advances by 1 note (or snapping interval), not recording anything. 1 : Inserts a stop note and advances. Page Up/Down : Moves the octave range that can be inputted using the QWERTY keyboard up/down. Snapping Snapping can be toggle by clicking the little magnet in the top-left corner of the piano roll. SHIFT+S can also be used to quickly toggle snapping on/off. The precision of the snapping can be changed by left/right clicking the number of using the mousewheel over the number or magnet icon. Using FamiStudio tempo mode will allow you to use both fractional snapping (1/4, 1/3, 1/2) and integer snapping (1, 2, 3, 4). FamiTracker tempo mode is limited to integer snapping since it does not give you full control over the individual frames. Fractional snapping will perform rounding when the number of frames in a note isnt exactly divisible by the precision. Adding, selecting and dragging of notes are currently the only actions affected by snapping. More might be added in future based on user feedback. Stop & Release notes Using Ctrl+click will add a stop note. Stops notes are displayed as little triangles. Although they are displayed next to the note preceding them, they actually have no pitch or instrument, they simply stop the sound. Stop notes are important because on the NES, a note will play indefinitely unless you tell it to stop. Using Shift+click will add a release notes. Release notes are shown as making the note thinner and triggers the envelope to jump to the release point. Release envelopes are useful to nicely fade out a note when its release, while preserving other effects like vibrato. There is no point to adding a release note to an instrument that does not have a release envelope. Hovering the mouse in the piano roll will display the location and note in the toolbar. Hovering over a note will display which instrument it uses. Note attack By default, notes will have an \"attack\" which mean they will restart their envelopes (volume, pitch, etc.) from the beginning. This is represented by the little dark rectangle on the left of each note. This can be toggled for a particular note by hold the A key and clicking on a note. Note that if a note does not use the same instrument as the previous one, the attack will still play, even if disabled. Also please note that this will generally not carry over to FamiTracker, besides specific use cases around slide notes. In this example, the first note will have an attack, while the second one will not. Since envelopes are not resetted, this means that if a note was released, it will remain released if the subsequent notes have no attack. Slide notes Slide notes are notes that start at a given pitch (the pitch of the note) and slowly change to hit a target pitch which is represented by where the triangle ends. In this example, the attack of the second note has been disabled. Slide notes garantees that the target pitch will be reached by the end of the note (end of the triangle) but this might happen a bit earlier than the visual repesentation suggests. Especially in the higher pitches. This is due to the fact that the pitch calculations are all integer-based (with 1-bit of fraction) and it is often impossible to get the exact required slope to reach the pitch at the exact time. Arpeggios Arpeggios (not to be confused with arpeggio instrument envelopes) are typically used to simulate chords by playing changing notes very rapidly. A note can optionally have an arpeggio associated to it, just like it has an instrument associated to it. When an arpeggio is used, the notes used by this arpeggio will be displayed in a semi-transparent way and the extra notes will take the color of the associated arpeggio. Note that in order to keep things simple, the individual sequence of notes inside the arpeggio will not be displayed. You can change which arpeggio is associated with a note the same way to can replace an instrument. You can select a new arpeggio and click on an existing note. Or you can select a few notes and drag and drop an arpeggio from the Project Explorer on to the selection. If an instrument uses an arpeggio envelope and also uses an arpeggio chord, the chord will take over and completely override the arpeggio envelope of the instrument. Selecting and editing notes You can select notes by right-clicking and dragging in the header of the piano roll or anywhere in the background of the piano roll (where there is no note). Selected notes will appear with a thick silver border. Once notes are selected, then can be moved using the arrows keys (up, down, left and right). Holding CTRL while doing so will make the notes move by larger increments. Cutting, copying and pasting notes Much like the sequencer, selcted notes can be copy (or cut) by pressing CTRL+C (or CTRL+X). You can then move the selection somewhere else and paste the notes with CTRL+V. Special paste \"Special paste\" is a more advanced form of pasting. It is used to to do things like pasting notes without their associated effets or volume track (or vice-versa), or to just paste specific effects. You can use a \"special paste\" by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+V. This will open a popup dialog. Mix With Existing Notes : The default behavior of pasting is to completely replace everything by the content of the clipboard. Using the \"Mix with existing notes\" option will preserve any existing data (notes, volumes, effects) and only insert new data if there is nothing there already. Paste Notes : Will paste the actual notes (including slide notes and arpeggio information). Paste Effects : You can choose the list of effect that you with to paste. Unchecked effect will not be pasted. Repeat : You can repeat the same paste operation multiple times to quickly repeat a sequence of note/effect values mutiple times. The start of the next paste will be where the last one ended. Special delete Much like Special paste, \"Special delete\" is a more advanced form of deletion. You can bring up the special delete dialong by selecting a rango of notes and pressing CTRL+SHIFT+DELETE. Delete Notes : If checked, will delete all the selected notes. Delete Effects : You can choose here the list of effects to delete. All unchecked effects will be preserved. Copy & pasting notes between projects It is possible to copy notes from one project to another. When doing so, FamiStudio will first look to make sure the instruments used by these notes exist in the other project. It will look for instruments having the same name . If some instruments are not found in the second project, it will offer you to create them for you, thus bringing the instrument from one project to another. For example, if you copy a note from project 1 using an instrument called \"Piano\", FamiStudio will look for an instrument named \"Piano\" in the second. If it finds one, it will assume it is the same (even though it might not be). If no \"Piano\" instrument is found, it will offer you to create it for you. This can be used as a way of transfering instruments from one project to another. Place a few notes using all the instruments you can to transfer. Copy them and paste them in the second project. Editing volume tracks & effects The effect panel can be opened by clicking the little triangle at the top-left of the piano roll. Here is the list of effects currently supported, note that not every effect is available on every channel: Volume : The overall volume of the channel. Vib Speed : Vibrato speed, used in conjuction with vibrato depth to create a vibrato effect. Vib Depth : Vibrato depth, used in conjuction with vibrato speed to create a vibrato effect. Pitch : Allow tweaking the fine-pitch of a channel. Duty Cycle : Allow changing the duty cycle of an instrument without using a duty cycle envelope (only instruments with no duty cycle envelopes will use the specifed value). FDS Speed : Famicom Disk System audio modulation speed (FDS audio expansion only). FDS Depth : Famicom Disk System audio modulation depth (FDS audio expansion only). Speed : Changes the speed of the song (FamiTracker tempo mode only) Note Delay : Number of frames to delay the current note (FamiTracker tempo mode only) Cut Delay : Stop the note after the specified number of frames (FamiTracker tempo mode only) Effects are edited by selecting and effect and dragging up or down to change the value. Right-clicking on an effect value deletes it. For effects that have huge values (such as FDS Depth), you can hold Shift to fine tune the exact value (a movement of 1 pixel will change the value by 1). Volume track The volume tracks dictates how loud the current channel should play. This volume is combined with volume envelope by multiplication (50% volume track x 50% envelope volume = 25% total volume). It is much more efficient to use volume envelopes wherever possible and only use volume tracks to control the global volume of the song. Vibrato depth & speed. Vibrato depth and speed are used to add vibrato to a portion of the song without having to bother creating a new instrument. Please note that vibrato will temporarely override any pitch envelope on the current instrument. When vibrato is disabled (by setting depth or speed, or both to zero), the instrument will essentially have no pitch envelope until a new note is played. The depth values for the vibrato are indentical to FamiTracker but the speeds are slightly different. The way FamiTracker implements vibrato, while clever, is flawed as it undersamples the vibrato curve at high speed, leading to aliasing which ends up with a low-frequency tone that has a \"ringing\" sound to it. Please see the Import/Export for a table that maps between FamiStudio and FamiTracker. Pitch Controls the global pitch of the track. Can be used to make an entire channel slightly out of tune. Duty Cycle Allow changing the duty cycle of an instrument without using a duty cycle envelope. This can only affect instruments with no duty cycle envelopes. This effect is mostly just there for compatibility with FamiTracker. Unless you have special cases where you often need to change the duty cycle, you should always favor creating different instruments instead of using this effect. Speed This changes the speed parameter of the FamiTracker tempo settings and is only available in FamiTracker tempo mode. Larger values will make the song scroll slower. Please refer to the Editing Songs & Project section for more information about tempo management. Note and Cut delay Note delays allows delaying the moment a note is played by a few frames while cut delay will stop a note after a few frames. This also is only available in FamiTracker tempo mode. Please refer to the Editing Songs & Project section for more information about tempo management.","title":"Editing Notes"},{"location":"pianoroll/#editing-notes","text":"The Piano Roll is where you editing the actual notes of the song, the instrument envelopes, as well as some special effects.

This section is going to focus on the very top part, which is the project and the songs. Editing project properties Double-clicking on project name (first button in the project explorer) will allow you to change its name, author and copyright information. This information is used when exporting to NSF, for example. Expansion audio The project properties is also where you select your Expansion Audio . Expansion will add extra channels on top of the default 5 that the NES supported. Note that changing the expansion audio in a project will delete all data (patterns, notes, instrument) related to the previous expansion. Please visit the Expansion Audio section for more detail about each expansion. Tempo modes FamiStudio supports two tempo modes : FamiStudio and FamiTracker . The tempo mode will affect how the tempo of you songs is calculated, how much control you have over the notes of your song and how your song plays on PAL systems. Note that changing the tempo mode when you have songs created is possible, but not recommended, the conversion is quite crude at the moment. FamiStudio Tempo Mode FamiStudio tempo modes gives full control over every frame (1/60th of a second on NTSC, 1/50th on PAL). It is the default mode. In this mode you will see the individual frames in the piano roll and will have more precise control on where each note starts/end. On the other hand, it makes suddent tempo changes harder to manage, and it is also harder to achieve \"non-integral\" tempos. It can faithfully recreate the vast majority of the NES music library very easily. For example, a C-D-E scale where each note is stopped for 1 frame between each note will look like this using FamiStudio tempo. The dashed lines seperate individual frames, so you can place a stop note (triangle) 1 frame before the new note starts. Very intuituve and visual. FamiTracker Tempo Mode FamiTracker tempo has a limited visual granularity and relies on effects (delayed notes/cuts) to get frame-level precision. It uses the speed/tempo paradigm. Please check out the FamiTracker documentation for a detailed explanation on how the playback speed is affected. If you import a FamiTracker Text or FTM file, the project will be in this tempo mode. Same example, but using FamiTracker tempo. Here we dont have the individual frames so we need to use a \"delayed cut\" effect to achieve the same result. The delayed cut tells the sound engine to insert a stop note after 9 frames have elapsed, achieving the exact same result. That being said, one might argue that it is not very visual and feels like using a Tracker. Moreover, this would not always work correctly on PAL. Which one to use? You should use FamiStudio tempo mode if: You want to be able to visually control the position of every note at a frame-level precision. You are not too strict about the BPM you want to achieve. You are not planning to do sophisticated tempo changes during the song. You should use FamiTracker tempo mode if: You are OK with using effects tracks (delayed notes, cuts) to finely tune the start/end of each notes. You want to achieve a very specific BPM, even if this mean some notes will be uneven. You want to have complex tempo changes during the song. You need compatibility with FamiTracker. Editing songs Right below the project name are the songs. Adding/Deleting songs To add new songs, simply click on the little \"+\" icon on the song header. Importing/Merging songs To merge a song coming from another project, click on the little folder icon on the song header. Songs from another project must use the same audio expansion and tempo mode. Also, please note that instruments, samples and arpeggios, used by the other song will be matched by their name. In other words, instruments with the same names are assumed to be the same. If you project already contains an instrument called \"Piano\" and you try to import a song using another one called \"Piano\", the existing one will be used. You are responsible to uniquely name your instruments if they are truly different. Editing song properties Double-clicking on the a song will allow you to change its name, color and other attributes. Names must be unique. This dialog will look different depending on the Tempo Mode of the current project. FamiStudio Tempo FamiTracker tempo Common properties: Song length : The number of patterns in the song Notes Per Pattern : Default number of notes in a pattern. Pattern length can be customized on a per-pattern basis in the Sequencer. Notes Per Beat : Number of notes in a beat. The piano roll will draw a darker line at every beat. Simply a visual aid, does not affect the audio in any way, although it does affect the displayed BPM calculation. It is recommended to keep that at 4. Properties unique FamiTracker tempo mode: Speed : How much the timer is increment each frame, values other than 150 might create uneven notes Tempo : How many frames to wait before advancing to the next note (at least when using the integral tempo or 150) Properties unique FamiStudio tempo mode: Frames Per Notes : How many frames (1/60th) in a typical notes. Values between 5 and 16 are recommended as they create the least error on PAL system. Tempo Configuring tempo in FamiStudio is definately less intuitive than in a regular DAW, so please bear with me. This is both for technical reasons (the fact that the NES runs at 50/60 FPS) and historical reasons (influence from FamiTracker). The key thing to understand is that the piano roll simply gives you a series of, what I am going to loosely call, notes ( rows if you come from FamiTracker). It is up to the composer to configure these notes and achieve the desired tempo and time signature. For example, let's look at the simple melody of the children song \"A, B, C, ...\". On the right side are the song settings that were used to achieve this. In this example, the project was set to use the FamiStudio tempo mode, but the same logic applies to the FamiTracker tempo mode. Click on the image to zoom in. Here is a zoomed-in version of the first beat. Observations: Frames are seperated by dashes grey line (they will disapear if you zoom out enough). Notes are seperated by thin grey lines. Beats are seperated by thin black lines. Patterns are seperated by thick black lines. Here we chosen to have 1 bar = 1 pattern, we could have chosen to fit the whole song in a single pattern, this is totally arbitrary. You should try to use a pattern size is a good tradeoff between reusability (being able to copy patterns and re-use them) and size (having many small patterns is annoying). The Frames per Note setting is the main driver of tempo and determines the base length our \"notes\". The more frames (1/60th of a second) we wait, the slower the song will play. So 8 frames per note give us a BPM of 112.5. When using FamiTracker tempo, this is the equalivalent of the Speed parameter. Also we have chosen to assemble 4 notes into a beat, and 4 beats in a pattern (16 notes), which is how we get something that looks like a 4/4 time signature. This also means our smallest granularity for our melody is 1/16th of a note. That being said, you can move notes at the frame-level, so you actually have a lot more control than this. Composite notes Note that you arent not limited to the BPM values suggested by the different note lengths. You can create in-between ones by putting multiples notes into a larger one. For example, Gimmick! uses a 11 frames per note, but puts 2 notes inside it. One of 5 frames and one of 6 frames. This creates an approximate tempo of 163.6 BPM and the different note lengths is not audible. The FamiTracker documentation has a handy chart for these. Note that you are limited to 18 frames per note a the moment. FamiStudio Tempo & PAL conversion This is a more technical discussion of how FamiStudio tempo handles NTSC -> PAL and PAL -> NTSC conversion. NTSC to PAL For example, in the image below, we have a NTSC song with 6 frames (1/60th of a sec) per note. On PAL system (50 FPS), if were were to play back this song, it would play 20% slower. To faitfully play back our NTSC song on PAL systems, FamiStudio will sometimes run 2 NTSC frames in a single PAL frame so it can keep up with NTSC. This makes the playback speed almost the same, but unfortunately, this is not always this simple. Let's take a note length of 8 frames for example. Again, if we were to try to naively play this back on PAL, it would play back 20% slower than NTSC. If we try to apply the same strategy of running 2 NTSC frame once per note, we would still end up playing 5% slower. The solution here is to skip 4 NTSC frames, over 3 notes to distribute the error. This ends up reduce the playback speed error well below 1%. This table sumarizes the number of frames that will be skipped on PAL for different note length. Number of NTSC frames (1/60 sec) Number of frames skipped by PAL Positions of potential double-frames BPM 1 1 double frames over 6 notes 1 900.0 2 1 double frames over 3 notes 01 450.0 3 1 double frames over 2 notes 010 300.0 4 2 double frames over 3 notes 0100 225.0 5 5 double frames over 6 notes 01000 180.0 6 1 double frames over 1 notes 010000 150.0 7 7 double frames over 6 notes 0100010 128.6 8 4 double frames over 3 notes 01000100 112.5 9 3 double frames over 2 notes 010001000 100.0 10 5 double frames over 3 notes 0100001000 90.0 11 11 double frames over 6 notes 01000001000 81.8 12 2 double frames over 1 notes 010000010000 75.0 13 13 double frames over 6 notes 0100010001000 69.2 14 7 double frames over 3 notes 01000100001000 64.3 15 5 double frames over 2 notes 010000100001000 60.0 16 8 double frames over 3 notes 0100001000010000 56.3 17 17 double frames over 6 notes 01000001000001000 52.9 18 3 double frames over 1 notes 010000010000010000 50.0 PAL to NTSC The sample principle apply when playing PAL songs on NTSC, but instead of running 2 frames rapidly, the sound engine will simply \"do nothing\" (idle) every once in a while to avoid going too fast.

It can faithfully recreate the vast majority of the NES music library very easily. For example, a C-D-E scale where each note is stopped for 1 frame between each note will look like this using FamiStudio tempo.

Overview The FamiStudio sound engine is used by the NSF and ROM exporter of FamiStudio and can be used to make homebrew NES/Famicom games. It supports every feature from FamiStudio, including audio expansions, and will continue to do so in the future. Some of these features are toggeable to save CPU/memory. The engine is essentially a heavily modified version of FamiTone2 by Shiru . A lot of his code and comments are still present, so massive thanks to him!! I am not trying to steal his work or anything, i renamed a lot of functions and variables because at some point it was becoming a mess of coding standards and getting hard to maintain. The engine, as well as a demo project, is available for all 3 major assemblers: CA65 NESASM ASM6 Features The engine has a basic set of features, as well as a few extra toggeable features that you may wish to disable to same CPU/RAM. If you disable a feature, you need to make sure that you definetaly are not using it in any of your songs. Using a feature in a song without enabling it in the song engine may lead to crashes (BRK) or undefined behaviors. The basic feature set that is always available in engine is: Support for the first four 2A03 channels (2 squares, triangle and noise channel). Support for the full 96 notes (C0 to B7). Instruments with duty cycle, volume, pitch and arpeggio envelopes. Absolute and relative pitch envelopes. Looping sections in envelopes. Release points for volume envelopes. Ability to change the speed (FamiTracker tempo mode only). Ability to loop over a portion of the song. Up to 64 instruments per export, an export can consist of as little as 1 song, or as many as 17. Features that can be toggled on/off depending on the needs of your projects: Audio expansions chips (at most one can be enabled) : VRC6, VRC7, FDS, S5B and N163. PAL/NTSC playback support. DPCM sample support Sound effect support (with configurable number of streams) Blaarg Smooth Vibrato technique to eliminate \"pops\" on square channels FamiTracker/FamiStudio tempo mode. Volume track support. Fine pitch track support. Slide notes. Vibrato effect. Arpeggios (not to be confused with arpeggio instrument envelopes which are always enabled). Duty cycle effect track Delayed notes/cuts (only when FamiTracker tempo is enabled) RAM/CODE usage Enabling more features will make the sound engine code larger and use more RAM. The zeropage usage is 7 bytes and can be easily aliased with some of your ZP variables as they are only used as temporary variables inside the famistudio_xxx subroutines. Here is a table to give a rough idea of the best/worst cast of RAM/CODE usage. Note that each column includes all features of the columns on the left. So the rightmost column has every feature enabled. In reality, you can toggle features individually. These tables where generated with only NTSC support, DPCM support enabled and no SFX streams. Code size RAM usage Demo A small demo is included with the engine sound code. The demo is available for all 3 major assemblers and they will all generate binary identical ROMs. The source code for the demo is located in the \\DemoSource subfolder. CA65: DemoSource\\demo_ca65.s NESASM: DemoSource\\demo_nesasm.asm ASM6: DemoSource\\demo_asm6.asm The songs used in the demo are available in the demo songs that are included with FamiStudio: Silver Surfer.fms Journey To Silius.fms Shatterhand.fms The sound effects used in the demo are available in SFX.fms, which is in the \\DemoAssets folder that comes with the sound engine. Integrating in your game The sound engine is contained in a single file which can be simply included in one of your assembly file, like it is done in the demo. CA65: famistudio_ca65.s NESASM: famistudio_nesasm.asm ASM6: famistudio_asm6.asm Another approach would be to compile the engine as a seperate obj file and link it. This might require you to import the famistudio_xxx calls in other parts of your project. All the instructions to use it in your project are included as comments at the top of these files. Interface The interface is pretty much the same as FamiTone2, with a slightly different naming convention. The subroutines you can call from your game are: famistudio_init : Initialize the engine with some music data. famistudio_music_play : Start music playback with a specific song. famistudio_music_pause : Pause/unpause music playback. famistudio_music_stop : Stops music playback. famistudio_sfx_init : Initialize SFX engine with SFX data. famistudio_sfx_play : Play a SFX. famistudio_sfx_sample_play : Play a DPCM SFX. famistudio_update : Updates the music/SFX engine, call once per frame, ideally from NMI. To play a song, you will need to first call famistudio_init with you song data, then famistudio_play with your song number, then call famistudio_update once per frame. Configuration There are 2 main ways of configuring the sound engine: Internally : which means modifying the famistudio_xxx assembly file directly. This is the simplest way for small projects. Externally : which means that all the configuration is done through defines provided from outside of the famistudio_xxx assembly file, without modifying it. This is the recommended way of using the engine when the code file is shared across multiple projects. This is how the NSF and ROM exported, as well as the demo project uses it, as they all points to the same engine file, but use different settings. To enable this mode, simply define FAMISTUDIO_CFG_EXTERNAL=1 and you will be in charge of providing all the configuration. There are four main things to configure in the engine: Segments (ZP/RAM/PRG) Audio expansion Global engine parameters Supported features Note that unless specified, the engine uses \"if\" and not \"ifdef\" for all boolean values so you need to define these to non-zero values. Undefined values will be assumed to be zero. 1. Segments Configuration You need to tell where you want to allocate the zeropage, RAM and code. This section will be slightly different for each assembler. CA65 For CA65, you need to specify the name of your ZEROPAGE, RAM/BSS and CODE/PRG segments as c-style macros (.define) like the example below. .define FAMISTUDIO_CA65_ZP_SEGMENT ZP .define FAMISTUDIO_CA65_RAM_SEGMENT RAM .define FAMISTUDIO_CA65_CODE_SEGMENT PRG NESASM For NESASM, you may specify the .rsset location for ZP/BSS and the .bank/.org location for the code. Optionally, the .zp/.bss/.code directives may be emitted. Please refer to the demo or engine assembly file for an example of how to use this. ; Define this to emit the \".zp\" directive before the zeropage variables. FAMISTUDIO_NESASM_ZP_SECTION = 1 ; Address where to allocate the zeropage variables that the engine use. FAMISTUDIO_NESASM_ZP_RSSET = $00a0 ; Define this to emit the \".bss\" directive before the RAM/BSS variables. FAMISTUDIO_NESASM_BSS_SECTION = 1 ; Address where to allocate the RAN/BSS variables that the engine use. FAMISTUDIO_NESASM_BSS_RSSET = $0400 ; Define this to emit the \".code\" directive before the code section. FAMISTUDIO_NESASM_CODE_SECTION = 1 ; Define this to emit the \".bank\" directive before the code section. FAMISTUDIO_NESASM_CODE_BANK = 0 ; Address where to place the engine code. FAMISTUDIO_NESASM_CODE_ORG = $8000 ASM6 For ASM6, you simply need to specify the location at which to allocate the ZP/BSS and CODE. FAMISTUDIO_ASM6_ZP_ENUM = $0000 FAMISTUDIO_ASM6_BSS_ENUM = $0200 FAMISTUDIO_ASM6_CODE_BASE = $8000 2. Audio Expansions Configuration You can enable up to one audio expansion (FAMISTUDIO_EXP_XXX). Enabling more than one expansion will lead to undefined behavior. Memory usage goes up as more complex expansions are used. The audio expansion you choose MUST MATCH with the data you will load in the engine. Loading a FDS song while enabling VRC6 will lead to undefined behavior. ; Konami VRC6 (2 extra square + saw) FAMISTUDIO_EXP_VRC6 = 1 ; Konami VRC7 (6 FM channels) FAMISTUDIO_EXP_VRC7 = 1 ; Nintendo MMC5 (2 extra squares, extra DPCM not supported) FAMISTUDIO_EXP_MMC5 = 1 ; Sunsoft S5B (2 extra squares, advanced features not supported.)

The engine is essentially a heavily modified version of FamiTone2 by Shiru . A lot of his code and comments are still present, so massive thanks to him!! I am not trying to steal his work or anything, i renamed a lot of functions and variables because at some point it was becoming a mess of coding standards and getting hard to maintain.

The basic feature set that is always available in engine is: Support for the first four 2A03 channels (2 squares, triangle and noise channel). Support for the full 96 notes (C0 to B7). Instruments with duty cycle, volume, pitch and arpeggio envelopes. Absolute and relative pitch envelopes. Looping sections in envelopes. Release points for volume envelopes. Ability to change the speed (FamiTracker tempo mode only). Ability to loop over a portion of the song. Up to 64 instruments per export, an export can consist of as little as 1 song, or as many as 17.
